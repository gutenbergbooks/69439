<h2 class="nobreak" id="ACKNOWLEDGMENTS">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS<br>
<span class="smaller">OF FINANCIAL AID IN MEETING THE EXPENSE OF THE EXPERIMENTS
HEREIN DESCRIBED</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The writer has been most generously aided by substantial
grants from the Bache Fund of the National Academy of
Sciences, and from the Carnegie Institution of Washington;
also by large donations from Mr. Horace Fletcher of Venice,
and from Mr. John H. Patterson of Dayton, Ohio. In addition,
the War Department of the United States met in large
measure the expense of maintaining at New Haven the Detachment
of Volunteers from the Hospital Corps of the United
States Army, detailed here through the courtesy of Surgeon-General
Robert Maitland O’Reilly.</p>

<h3>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS<br>
<span class="smaller">OF AID IN THE CONDUCT OF THE EXPERIMENTS</span></h3>

<p>The successful carrying out of the experiments in all their
details, especially the chemical work, has been rendered possible
by the active and continuous co-operation of the writer’s
colleague, Lafayette B. Mendel, Ph.D., Professor of Physiological
Chemistry in the Sheffield Scientific School.</p>

<p>Efficient aid in the routine chemical and other work of the
laboratory in connection with the experiments has been rendered
by Frank P. Underhill, Ph.D., Arthur L. Dean, Ph.D.,
Harold C. Bradley, B.A., Robert B. Gibson, Ph.B., Oliver E.
Closson, Ph.B., and Charles S. Leavenworth, Ph.B.</p>

<p>Dr. William G. Anderson, Director of the Yale Gymnasium,
with the co-operation of his assistants, has rendered valuable
aid in looking after the physical development of the men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
under experiment, in arranging for frequent strength tests,
as well as in prescribing the character and extent of their
work in the Gymnasium. The greater portion of the training
of the soldiers was under the personal supervision of William
H. Callahan, M.D., Medical Assistant at the Gymnasium,
while Messrs. William Chase, Anton Muller, John Stapleton,
and H. R. Gladwin, Assistant Instructors in the Gymnasium,
led the drills and looked after the actual muscular training
of the men.</p>

<p>In the study of “Reaction Time” and other matters of
psychological interest the work was under the direction of
Charles H. Judd, Ph.D., in charge of the Yale Psychological
Laboratory, aided by Warren M. Steele, B.A., and Cloyd N.
McAllister, Ph.D.</p>

<p>In the morphological study of the blood, etc., Dr. Wallace
DeWitt, Lieutenant in command of the Army detail, rendered
valuable aid. Dr. DeWitt likewise co-operated in all possible
ways during his stay in New Haven to maintain the integrity
of the conditions necessarily imposed on the soldier detail in
an experiment of this character.</p>

<p>Further, acknowledgments are due the several non-commissioned
officers of the Hospital Corps for their intelligent
co-operation and interest. Finally, to the men of the Hospital
Corps who volunteered for the experiment, our thanks are due
for their cheerful compliance with the many restrictions placed
upon them during their six months’ sojourn in New Haven,
and for the manly way in which they conducted themselves
under conditions not always agreeable.</p>

<p>To the students of the University who volunteered as subjects
of experiment our acknowledgments are due for their
intelligent co-operation, keen interest, and hearty compliance
with the conditions imposed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

</div>

<p>There is no subject of greater physiological importance, or
of greater moment for the welfare of the human race, than
the subject of nutrition. How best to maintain the body in
a condition of health and strength, how to establish the highest
degree of efficiency, both physical and mental, with the
least expenditure of energy, are questions in nutrition that
every enlightened person should know something of, and yet
even the expert physiologist to-day is in an uncertain frame
of mind as to what constitutes a proper dietary for different
conditions of life and different degrees of activity. We hear
on all sides widely divergent views regarding the needs of the
body, as to the extent and character of the food requirements,
contradictory statements as to the relative merits of animal
and vegetable foods; indeed, there is great lack of agreement
regarding many of the fundamental questions that constantly
arise in any consideration of the nutrition of the human body.
Especially is this true regarding the so-called dietary standards,
or the food requirements of the healthy adult. Certain general
standards have been more or less widely adopted, but a careful
scrutiny of the conditions under which the data were collected
leads to the conclusion that the standards in question have a
very uncertain value, especially as we see many instances of
people living, apparently in good physical condition, under a
<i>régime</i> not at all in harmony with the existing standards.</p>

<p>Especially do we need more definite knowledge of the true
physiological necessities of the body for proteid or albuminous
foods, <i>i. e.</i>, those forms of foods that we are accustomed to
speak of as the essential foods, since they are absolutely
requisite for life. If our ideas regarding the daily quantities
of these foods necessary for the maintenance of health and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
strength are exaggerated, then a possible physiological economy
is open to us, with the added possibility that health and vigor
may be directly or indirectly increased. Further, if through
years and generations of habit we have become addicted to
the use of undue quantities of proteid foods, quantities way
beyond the physiological requirements of the body, then we
have to consider the possibility that this excess of daily food
may be more or less responsible for many diseased conditions,
which might be obviated by more careful observance of the
true physiological needs of the body.</p>

<p>First, however, we must have more definite information as
to what the real necessities of the body for proteid food are,
and this information can be obtained only by careful scientific
experimentation under varying conditions. This has been
the object of the present study, and the results obtained are
now placed before the public with the hope that they will
prove not only of scientific interest and value, but that they
will also serve to arouse an interest in the minds of thoughtful
people in a subject which is surely of primary importance
for the welfare of mankind. That the physical condition of
the body exercises an all-powerful influence upon the mental
state, and that a man’s moral nature even is influenced by his
bodily condition are equally certain; hence, the subject of
nutrition, when once it is fully understood and its precepts
obeyed, bids fair to exert a beneficial influence not only upon
bodily conditions, but likewise upon the welfare of mankind
in many other directions.</p>

<p>In presenting the results of the experiments, herein described,
the writer has refrained from entering into lengthy
discussions, preferring to allow the results mainly to speak
for themselves. They are certainly sufficiently convincing
and need no superabundance of words to give them value;
indeed, such merit as the book possesses is to be found in
the large number of consecutive results, which admit of no
contradiction and need no argument to enhance their value.
The results presented are scientific facts, and the conclusions
they justify are self-evident.</p>

<h1>PHYSIOLOGICAL ECONOMY<br>
IN NUTRITION</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTORY">INTRODUCTORY</h2>

<p class="smaller"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—For the benefit of lay readers, <i>metabolism</i>, a word frequently made
use of, may be defined as a term applied to the collective chemical changes
taking place in living matter. When these metabolic changes are constructive,
as in the building up of tissue protoplasm from the absorbed food material,
they are termed <i>anabolic</i>; when they are destructive, as in the breaking
down of living matter or in the decomposition of the materials stored up in
the tissues and organs, they are termed <i>katabolic</i>. Proteid metabolism, or
more exactly proteid katabolism, therefore, means the destructive decomposition
of proteid or albuminous matter in the living body and is practically
synonymous with nitrogenous metabolism, since the entire nitrogen income
is mainly supplied by the proteids or albuminous matters of the food. The
chief carbon income, on the other hand, is supplied by fats and carbohydrates,
such as starches and sugars.</p>

</div>

<p>As the result of many years of observation and experiment
certain general conclusions have been arrived at regarding
the requisite amounts of food necessary for the maintenance
of health and strength. Certain dietary standards have been
set up which have found more or less general acceptance in
most parts of the civilized world; standards which have been
reinforced and added to by man’s aptitude for self-indulgence.
Carl Voit, of Munich, whose long and successful life as a
student of Nutrition renders his conclusions of great value,
considers that an adult man of average body-weight (70-75
kilos) doing moderate muscular work requires daily 118 grams
of proteid or albuminous food, of which 105 grams should be
absorbable, 56 grams of fat, and 500 grams of carbohydrate,
with a total fuel value of over 3000 large calories, in order
to maintain the body in equilibrium. The Voit standard or
daily diet is accepted more or less generally as representing
the needs of the body under normal conditions of life, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
the conclusions arrived at by other investigators along these
same lines have been more or less in accord with Voit’s
figures. In confirmation of this statement the following data
may be quoted:</p>

<p>In many of these diets it is to be noted that the proteid
requirement is placed at even a higher figure than Voit’s
standard. Similarly, Erisman, studying the diets of Russian
workmen having a free choice of food and doing moderately
hard work, found the daily diet to be composed of 131.8 grams
of proteid, 79.7 grams of fat, and 583.8 grams of carbohydrate,
with a total fuel value of 3675 large calories. Further, Hultgren
and Landergren<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> found that Swedish laborers doing hard
work had as their daily diet 189 grams of proteid, 110 grams
of fat, and 714 grams of carbohydrate, with a total fuel value
of 4726 large calories. Voit found that German soldiers on
active service consumed daily 145 grams of proteid, 100 grams
of fat, and 500 grams of carbohydrate, with a total fuel value<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
of 3574 large calories. Lichtenfelt,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> studying the nutrition
of Italians, states that an Italian laborer doing a moderate
amount of work requires 110.5 grams of proteid and a total
fuel value for the daily food of 2698 calories, while at hard
labor he needs 146 grams of proteid daily, with carbohydrates
and fat sufficient to give 3088 large calories. In our own
country Atwater,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> who has made many valuable observations
upon the dietetic habits of different classes of people and
under different conditions of life, has stated that a somewhat
more liberal allowance of proteid would seem desirable, say
125 grams, with a total fuel value of 3500 large calories for a
man doing severe muscular labor.</p>

<p>In what is perhaps the latest book on alimentation, Armand
Gautier,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> writing of the French people, states that the ordinary
man in that climate needs daily 110 grams of albuminous
food, 68 grams of fat, and about 423 grams of amylaceous
or saccharine food. It is possible, however, says Gautier,
that the quantity of albuminous food can be reduced, if
necessary, to 78 grams per day in case a man is not doing
work and takes in addition at least 50 grams of fat and 485
grams of carbohydrate food. Where, however, an individual
works eight to ten hours a day, the ration, says Gautier, must
be increased to at least 135 grams of albuminous food, with
85 to 100 grams of fat, and with from 500 to 900 grams of
starchy food.</p>

<p>While these figures may be taken as showing quite conclusively
the dietetic standards adopted by mankind, there is
no evidence whatever that they represent the real needs or
requirements of the body. We may even question whether
simple observation of the kinds and amounts of food consumed
by different classes of people under different conditions of life
have any very important bearing upon this question. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
throw light upon dietetic habits, it is true, but such observations
give no information as to how far the diets in question
serve the real needs of the body. We may find, for example,
that under certain given conditions of diet the people in question
have the appearance of being well nourished, and that
they do their work with apparent ease and comfort; but might
not these same results follow with smaller amounts of food?
If so, there must of necessity be a certain amount of physiological
economy under the more restricted diet, and a consequent
ultimate gain to the body through diminished wear and
tear of the bodily machinery.</p>

<p>Indeed, experimental work and observations scattered
through the last few years have suggested the possibility
of much lower standards of diet sufficing to meet the real
physiological needs of the body. Thus, Hirschfeld,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> in 1887,
found in experimenting on himself (24 years of age and
weighing 73 kilos) that it was possible to maintain nitrogen
equilibrium on a diet containing only 5 to 7.5 grams of nitrogen
per day, or 35 to 45 grams of proteid, for a period of ten
to fifteen days. The amount of non-nitrogenous food consumed,
however, was fairly large, especially the amount of
butter,—frequently 100 grams a day—the average fuel value
ranging from 3750 to 3916 large calories daily. In 1888
Hirschfeld,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> again experimenting on himself, maintained nitrogen
equilibrium for several days on 7.5 grams of nitrogen per
day, with fats and carbohydrate sufficient to yield a total fuel
value of 3462 large calories as the daily average. The chief
criticism of Hirschfeld’s experiments is that he failed to obtain
in all cases definite analytical data of the food-stuffs employed
and failed to determine the nitrogen of the fæces. Still his
results are of value as indicating the possibility of maintaining
nitrogenous equilibrium for a brief time at least on a low
proteid intake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>Kumagawa,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> studying especially the diet of the Japanese
and experimenting on himself (27 years old and weighing 48
kilos), found with a purely vegetable diet, containing per day
54.7 grams of proteid, 2.5 grams of fat, and 569.8 grams of
carbohydrate, that he showed for a period of nine days a plus
balance of nitrogen, indicating that his body was laying on
about 4 grams of proteid per day. The nitrogen excreted per
urine and fæces amounted to 8.09 grams per day, while the
nitrogen in the daily food amounted to 8.75 grams. It is
interesting to observe in these experiments, as indicating the
degree of absorption of the vegetable food (composed in large
measure of rice) that the daily average of nitrogen in the
urine amounted to 6.069 grams and in the fæces 2.029 grams.
In other words, of the 54.7 grams of nitrogen-containing food
only 37.8 grams were absorbed, 12.69 grams passing out with
the fæces. The total fuel value of the absorbed food per day
was 2478 large calories. Similarly, Hirschfeld<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> has called
attention to the fact that with many vegetable foods especially,
not more than 75 per cent of the ingested proteid can
be digested and absorbed, thus emphasizing the necessity of
paying heed to the <i>character</i> of the proteid food in considering
the nutritive value of a given diet.</p>

<p>In some experiments reported by C. Voit<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> in 1889, on the
diet of vegetarians, E. Voit and Constantinidi found that
nitrogenous equilibrium was established in one man with
about 8 grams of nitrogen, corresponding to 48.5 grams of
proteid as the daily diet, with large amounts of starchy foods
and some fat. Similarly, Nakahama<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> in the same year, studying
the diet (mostly vegetable) and nutritive condition of
thirteen German laborers in Leipzig, found that their daily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
food contained on an average 85 grams of proteid, but Carl
Voit criticising these results states that the men were of
comparatively light body-weight—about 60 kilos—and not
well nourished.</p>

<p>Kellner and Mori,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> studying the nutrition of a Japanese
(weighing 52 kilos and 23 years of age) state that on a purely
vegetable diet containing 11.34 grams of nitrogen, of which
only 8.58 grams were digested, there was a distinct loss of
body-weight, with a daily loss to the body of 1.16 grams of
nitrogen. On a mixed diet, however, containing fish, it was
possible to establish nitrogenous equilibrium with a daily diet
containing 17.48 grams of nitrogen, of which 15.27 grams
were digested and utilized. Similarly, Caspari,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> 29 years
old and weighing 66.2 kilos, found that while he could maintain
his body in nitrogenous equilibrium on 13.26 grams of
nitrogen per day, he could not accomplish it on 10.1 grams
of nitrogen, though his daily food contained 3200 large
calories.</p>

<p>Other investigators, however, have found no great difficulty
in establishing nitrogenous equilibrium in man with much
lower quantities of proteid food. Thus, Klemperer<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> found
in the case of two young men of 64 and 65.5 kilos body-weight
respectively, in an experiment lasting eight days, that nitrogenous
equilibrium was established on 4.38 and 3.58 grams of
nitrogen per day, but with a daily diet containing in addition
to the small amount of proteid 264 grams of fat, 470.4 grams
of carbohydrate, and 172 grams of alcohol, with a total fuel
value of 5020 large calories.</p>

<p>Peschel,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> too, has reported experimental results showing
that he was able to establish nitrogenous equilibrium for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
brief period with 7 grams of nitrogen daily, 5.31 grams appearing
in the urine and 1.58 grams in the fæces.</p>

<p>Caspari and Glaessner,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> in a five-days’ experiment with two
vegetarians, found that the wife consumed daily, on an average,
5.33 grams of nitrogen, with fats and carbohydrates to equal
2715 calories, while the man took in 7.82 grams of nitrogen
and 4559 calories. Both persons laid on nitrogen in spite of
the low intake of proteid food.</p>

<p>Siven’s<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> experiments, however, are perhaps worthy of more
careful consideration. Of 60 kilos body-weight and 30½
years of age, his experiments conducted on himself extended
through thirty-two days with establishment of nitrogenous
equilibrium on 6.26 grams of nitrogen. Moreover, in another
experiment he was in nitrogen equilibrium for a day or two
at least on 4.5 grams of nitrogen. In Siven’s experiment, the
most noticeable feature is the added fact that the total intake
of food per day was comparatively low, with a fuel value of
only 2444 large calories. In this connection we may call
attention to the recent experiments of Landergren,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> who
found with four individuals fed on a daily diet containing
only 2.1 to 2.4 grams of nitrogen, but with a large amount of
carbohydrate, some fat and alcohol, that on the fourth day
of this “specific nitrogen hunger” only 3 to 4 grams of nitrogen
were metabolized and appeared in the urine. In other
words, a healthy adult man having a sufficient intake of non-nitrogenous
food seemingly need not metabolize more proteid
than suffices to yield 3 to 4 grams of nitrogen per day.</p>

<p>Such data as these, of which many more might be quoted,
surely warrant the question, how far are we justified in assuming
the necessity for the rich proteid diet called for by
the Voit standard? Voit, however, with many other physiologists<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
would apparently object to any diminution of the daily
118 grams of proteid for the moderate worker, on the ground
that an abundance of proteid in the food is a necessity for the
maintenance of physical vigor and muscular activity. This
view is certainly reinforced by the customs and habits of
mankind; but we may well query whether our dietetic habits
will bear criticism, and in the light of modern scientific inquiry
we may even express doubt as to whether a rich proteid
diet adds anything to our muscular energy or bodily strength.</p>

<p>How far can our natural instinct be trusted in the choice of
diet? We are all creatures of habit, and our palates are
pleasantly excited by the rich animal foods with their high
content of proteid, and we may well question whether our
dietetic habits are not based more upon the dictates of our
palates than upon scientific reasoning or true physiological
needs. There is a prevalent opinion that to be well nourished
the body must have a large excess of fat deposited throughout
the tissues, and that all bodily ills and weaknesses are to be
met and combated by increased intake of food. There is
constant temptation to increase the daily ration, and there is
almost universal belief in the efficacy of a rich and abundant
diet to strengthen the body and to increase bodily and mental
vigor. Is there any justification for these beliefs? None,
apparently, other than that which comes from the customs
of generations of high living.</p>

<p>It is self-evident that the smallest amount of food that will
serve to keep the body in a state of high efficiency is physiologically
the most economical, and hence the best adapted for
the needs of the organism. Any excess over and above what
is really needed is not only uneconomical, but may be directly
injurious. This is especially true of the proteid or albuminous
foods. It is, however, quite proper to question whether
a brief experiment of a few days in which nitrogenous equilibrium
is perhaps established at the low level of 4 to 5 grams
of nitrogen, the equivalent of 25 to 35 grams of proteid, is to be
accepted as fixing the daily requirements of the healthy man,
offsetting the customs or habits of a lifetime. Voit himself,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
however, has clearly emphasized the general principle that
the smallest amount of proteid, with non-nitrogenous food
added, that will suffice to keep the body in a state of continual
vigor is the ideal diet. Proteid decomposition products are a
constant menace to the well-being of the body; any quantity of
proteid or albuminous food beyond the real requirements of the
body may prove distinctly injurious. We see the evil effects
of uric acid in gout, but there are many other nitrogenous
waste products of proteid katabolism, which with excess of
proteid food are liable to be unduly conspicuous in the fluids
and tissues of the body, and may do more or less damage
prior to their excretion through the kidneys. Further, it
requires no imagination to understand the constant strain
upon the liver and kidneys, to say nothing of possible influence
upon the central and peripheral parts of the nervous
system, by these nitrogenous waste products which the body
ordinarily gets rid of as speedily as possible. They are an
ever present evil, but why increase them unnecessarily? This
question brings us back to the starting-point. What is the
minimal proteid requirement for the healthy man, or rather,
how far can we safely and advantageously diminish our
proteid intake below the commonly accepted standards?</p>

<p>The question of safety is a pertinent one. Thus, Munk<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
some years ago (1893) sounded a warning on this point which
was later confirmed by Rosenheim.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Both of these observers
reported that in dogs fed for some time on a low proteid diet,
but with an abundance of carbohydrate and fat, there was
after some weeks (6-8) a loss of the power of absorption from
the alimentary tract, dependent not alone upon a changed
condition of the epithelial cells of the intestine, but also upon
a diminished secretion of the digestive juices, loss of body-weight,
strength, and vigor, followed speedily by death. If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
these results were really due to the low proteid diet, they
suggest a grave danger which must not be lightly passed by.
Jägerroos<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> has likewise observed, experimenting on dogs,
that there was, after some months, a striking disturbance of
the intestines on a low proteid intake, which, however, was
eventually traced to a distinct infection, and probably in no
manner connected with the diminished amount of proteid in
the diet. In these various experiments on dogs carried out
by Munk, Rosenheim, and by Jägerroos, there was of necessity
great monotony in the diet, and in Munk’s experiments
no fresh meat at all was fed, but simply dried food. In other
words, if the diet was in any sense responsible for the poor
health of the animals, it is fully as plausible to attribute the
results to the abnormal conditions under which the animals
were kept as to any specific effect due to the low proteid intake.
It is very essential that the food of dogs, as of men,
shall fulfil all ordinary hygienic conditions. It must be not
only of sufficient quantity for the true needs of the body, but
it should also have the necessary variety with reasonable degree
of digestibility, and proper volume or bulk. When
these qualities are lacking, it is not strange if deviations from
the normal gradually develop. That the low intake of proteid
food could be responsible for the condition existing in Munk’s
and Rosenheim’s experiments is not plausible; a view which
is strongly reinforced by many observations, notably those of
Albu<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> on a woman thirty-seven years old and weighing 37.5
kilos, who had followed a vegetarian diet for six years, and
who while under Albu’s care for two years consumed only
34 grams of proteid per day, the total fuel value of the food
being only 1400 calories per day. This woman was in nitrogenous
equilibrium on 5.4 grams of nitrogen, and on this diet
had freed herself from the illness to which she had long been
subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>Voit’s<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> vegetarian is described by Voit himself as a man
twenty-eight years old, weighing 57 kilos, well nourished,
with well developed muscles, etc. He had lived on a purely
vegetable diet for three years, and was found to be in nitrogenous
equilibrium on 8.2 grams of nitrogen. No mention
is made of any disagreeable effects connected with this
low proteid ration, although persisted in for several years.
Jaffa’s<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> experiments and observations on the fruitarians and
nutarians of California “showed in every case (two women
and three children) that though the diet had a low protein
and energy value, the subjects were apparently in excellent
health and had been so during the five to eight years they had
been living in this manner.” In comparing the income and
outgo of nitrogen on a diet composed mainly of nuts and
fruits, it was observed in two subjects that 8 grams of nitrogen
were sufficient to bring about nitrogen equilibrium, while
with two other subjects on a like diet the nitrogen required
daily for equilibrium was about 10 grams. The diet used in
these experiments, however, was of necessity more or less
restricted in variety, and was without doubt somewhat monotonous.
Jaffa appears to agree with Caspari that the minimum
amount of proteid required daily varies with the individual,
and may even vary with the same individual at different
times. Further, Jaffa, in harmony with Siven, believes that
after the body has suffered a loss of nitrogen, there is at once
an effort to attain nitrogenous equilibrium, and that any gain
of nitrogenous body material is a comparatively slow process.
If this is true, it is obvious that the living substance of the
tissue protoplasm must be <i>slowly</i> formed from the proteid of
the diet. This, says Jaffa, should serve as a warning to anyone
contemplating any appreciable decrease in the proteid of
the daily diet.</p>

<p>Another statement made by Jaffa may be quoted in this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
connection, since it illustrates the attitude taken by many
physiologists on this question. “Even if it could be proved,”
says Jaffa, “by a large number of experiments that nitrogen
equilibrium can be maintained on a small amount of protein,
it would still be a great question whether or not it would be
wise to do so. There must certainly be a constant effort on
the part of the human organism to attain this condition, and
with a low protein supply it might be forced to do so under
conditions of strain. In such a case the bad results might be
slow in manifesting themselves, but might also be serious and
lasting. It has also been suggested that when living at a fairly
high protein level the body is more resistant to disease and
other strains than when the protein level is low.” While these
suggestions demand careful consideration, it is equally evident
that there is another side to the question, viz., the possible
danger to the body from the physiological action of the larger
amounts of nitrogenous waste products which result from an
excess of proteid food, and which float about through the
system prior to their excretion. In addition, we must not
overlook the great loss of energy to the body in handling and
getting rid of the surplus of unnecessary food of whatever kind
introduced into the alimentary tract, to say nothing of the
danger of intestinal putrefaction and toxæmia when from any
cause the system loses its ability to digest and absorb the excess
of food consumed. Further, the possible strain on the kidneys
and other organs must not be overlooked. Hence we may
well query on which side lies the greater danger. To an
unprejudiced observer, one not wedded to old-time tradition,
it would seem as if great effort was being made to sustain the
claims of a high-proteid intake. It is surely well to be careful,
but it is certainly not necessary to magnify imaginary
dangers to the extent of suppressing all efforts toward the
establishment of possible physiological economy.</p>

<p>In a paper read before the Physiological Section of the
British Medical Association in 1901 by Dr. van Someren,
claim is made of the existence of a reflex of deglutition, the
proper working of which protects from the results of malnutrition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
by preventing the intake of any excess of food.
Thorough mastication and insalivation aid in the more complete
utilization of the food and render possible great economy,
so that body-weight and nitrogen equilibrium are both maintained
on an exceptionally small amount of food. This
principle had been worked out by Mr. Horace Fletcher on
himself in an attempt to restore his health to a normal condition,
with such beneficial results that he was speedily
restored to a state of exceptional vigor and well-being. Deliberation
in eating, necessitated by the habit of thorough
insalivation, it is claimed results in the occurrence of satiety
on the ingestion of comparatively small amounts of food, and
hence all excess of food is avoided.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1901, Mr. Fletcher and Dr. van Someren
visited the physiological laboratories of Cambridge University,
and as stated by Sir Michael Foster<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> the matter was more
closely inquired into with the assistance of physiological experts.
Observations were carried out on various individuals,
and as stated by Professor Foster “the adoption of the habit
of thorough insalivation of the food was found in a consensus
of opinion to have an immediate and very striking effect upon
appetite, making this more discriminating, and leading to the
choice of a simple dietary, and in particular reducing the craving
for flesh food. The appetite, too, is beyond all question
fully satisfied with a dietary considerably less in amount than
with ordinary habits is demanded.”... “In two individuals
who pushed the method to its limits it was found that complete
bodily efficiency was maintained for some weeks upon a dietary
which had a total energy value of less than one-half of that
usually taken, and comprised little more than one-third of the
proteid consumed by the average man.” Finally, says Foster,
“it may be doubted if continued efficiency could be maintained
with such low values as these, and very prolonged
observations would be necessary to establish the facts. But
all subjects of the experiments who applied the principles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
intelligently agreed in finding a very marked reduction in
their needs, and experienced an increase in their sense of well-being
and an increase in their working powers.”</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1902 and in the early part of 1903, Mr.
Fletcher spent several months with the writer, thereby giving
an opportunity for studying his habits of life. For a period
of thirteen days in January he was under constant observation
in the writer’s laboratory, when it was found that the average
daily amount of proteid metabolised was 41.25 grams, his
body-weight (75 kilos) remaining practically constant. Later,
a more thorough series of observations was made, involving a
careful analysis of the daily diet, together with analysis of the
excreta. For a period of six days the daily diet averaged
44.9 grams of proteid, 38.0 grams of fat, and 253 grams of carbohydrate,
the total fuel value amounting to only 1606 large
calories per day. The daily intake of nitrogen averaged 7.19
grams, while the daily output through the urine was 6.30
grams and in the fæces 0.6 gram; <i>i. e.</i>, a daily intake of
7.19 grams of nitrogen, with a total output of 6.90 grams,
showing a daily gain to the body of 0.29 gram of nitrogen,
and this on a diet containing less than half the proteid required
by the Voit standard and having only half the fuel
value of the Voit diet. Further, it was found by careful and
thorough tests made at the Yale Gymnasium that Mr. Fletcher,
in spite of this comparatively low ration was in prime physical
condition. In the words of Dr. Anderson, the Director of the
Gymnasium, “the case is unusual, and I am surprised that
Mr. Fletcher can do the work of trained athletes and not give
marked evidences of over-exertion.... Mr. Fletcher performs
this work with greater ease and with fewer noticeable
bad results than any man of his age and condition I have ever
worked with.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> It is not our purpose here to discuss how
far these results are due to insalivation, or the more thorough
mastication of food. The main point for us is that we have
here a striking illustration of the establishment of nitrogen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
equilibrium on a low proteid diet and great physiological
economy as shown by the low fuel value of the food consumed,
coupled with remarkable physical strength and endurance.</p>

<p>With data such as these before us we see the possible importance
of a fuller and more exact knowledge of true dietary
standards. We find here questions suggested, the answers to
which are of primary importance in our understanding of the
nutritive processes of the body; greater ease in the maintenance
of health, increased power of resistance to disease
germs, duration of life increased beyond the present average,
greater physiological economy and greater efficiency, increased
mental and physical vigor with less expenditure of energy on
the part of the body. All these questions rise before us in
connection with the possibility of maintaining equilibrium
on a lowered intake of food, especially nitrogenous equilibrium,
with a diminished consumption of proteid or albuminous
food. Is it not possible that the accepted dietary standards
are altogether too high?</p>

<p>It is of course understood that there can be no fixed dietary
standard suitable for all people, ages, and conditions of life.
Dietary standards at the best are merely an approximate indication
of the amounts of food needed by the body, but these
needs are obviously changeable, varying with the degree of
activity of the body, especially the amount of physical work
performed, to say nothing of differences in body-weight, sex,
etc. Further, it is doubtless true that there is what may be
called a specific coefficient of nutrition characteristic of the
individual, a kind of personal idiosyncrasy which exercises in
some degree a modifying influence upon the character and
extent of the changes going on in the body. Still, with due
recognition of the general influence exerted by these various
factors the main question remains, viz., how far the usually
accepted standards of diet are correct; or, in other words, is
there any real scientific ground for the assumption that the
average individual doing an average amount of work requires
any such quantity of proteid, or of total nutrients, as the ordinary
dietetic standards call for? Cannot all the real physiological<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
needs of the body be met by a greatly reduced
proteid intake, with establishment of continued nitrogenous
equilibrium on a far smaller amount of proteid food than the
ordinary dietary standards call for, and with actual gain to
the body?</p>

<p>Just here we may emphasize why prominence is given to
the establishment of <i>nitrogenous</i> equilibrium, and why the
proteid intake assumes a greater importance than the daily
amounts of fat and carbohydrate consumed. Fats and carbohydrates
when oxidized in the body are ultimately burned
to simple gaseous products, viz., carbonic acid and water.
Hence, these waste products are easily and quickly eliminated
and cannot exercise much deleterious influence even
when formed in excess. To be sure, there is waste of energy
in digesting, absorbing, and oxidizing the fats and carbohydrates
when they are taken in excessive amounts. Once introduced
into the alimentary canal they must be digested,
otherwise they will clog the intestine or undergo fermentation,
and so cause trouble. Further, when absorbed they may
be transformed into fat and deposited in the various tissues and
organs of the body; a process desirable up to a certain point,
but undesirable when such accumulation renders the body
gross and unwieldy. With proteid foods, on the other hand,
the story is quite different. These substances, when oxidized,
yield a row of crystalline nitrogenous products which ultimately
pass out of the body through the kidneys. Prior to their
excretion, however, these products—frequently spoken of as
toxins—float about through the body and may exercise more
or less of a deleterious influence upon the system, or, being
temporarily deposited, may exert some specific or local influence
that calls for their speedy removal. Hence, the importance
of restricting the production of these bodies to the
minimal amount, owing to their possible physiological effect
and the part they are liable to play in the causation of many
diseased conditions. Further, the elimination of excessive
amounts of these crystalline nitrogenous bodies through the
kidneys places upon these organs an unnecessary burden which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
is liable to endanger their integrity and possibly result in serious
injury, to say nothing of an early impairment of function.</p>

<p class="tb">The present experiments were undertaken to throw light
upon this broad question of a possible physiological economy
in nutrition, and with special reference to the minimal proteid
requirement of the healthy man under ordinary conditions of
life. The writer as a student of physiology has always maintained
that man is disposed to eat far more than the needs of
the body require, but his active interest in this problem was
aroused especially by his observations of Mr. Fletcher and the
marked physiological economy the latter was able to practice,
not only without detriment, but apparently with great gain to
the body as regards strength, vigor, and endurance, coupled
with an apparent resistance to disease. While Mr. Fletcher
and Dr. Van Someren would doubtless emphasize the importance
of insalivation as a means of controlling the appetite and
thereby regulating the consumption of food in harmony with
the real needs of the body, it is of primary importance for the
physiologist and for mankind to know definitely how far it is
possible to reduce the intake of food with perfect safety and
without loss of that strength, mental and physical, vigor, and
endurance which are characteristic of good health. Further,
it is equally plain that if there is possible gain to the body
from a practice of physiological economy in diet, we should
know how far this can be accomplished by simple restriction
in the amount of food without complicating the problem by
other factors.</p>

<p>In planning the conduct of this series of experiments the
writer has clearly recognized that, while it may be possible, as
previous experiments have shown, to maintain body equilibrium
and nitrogen equilibrium on a low proteid diet for a
brief period, this fact does not, as Munk has previously
pointed out, by any means establish the view that such a diet
will prove efficient in maintaining equilibrium for a long
period, or that bodily strength and vigor can be kept up and
the proper resistance to disease secured. Hence, it seemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
necessary to so arrange the experiments that they should continue
not for a few days or weeks merely, but through months
and years. Further, it is very questionable whether the restricted
diet (restricted in variety) frequently made use of for
convenience in ordinary metabolism experiments is well adapted
for bringing out the best results. Hence, it was decided to
avoid so far as possible any monotony of diet, giving due recognition
to the psychical influences liable to affect secretion,
digestion, etc., so admirably worked out by Pawlow in his
classical experiments on these subjects; influences which are
unquestionably of great importance in controlling and modifying,
in some measure at least, the nutritive changes in the
body. Again, it is evident that to have experiments of this
character broadly useful, they must be tried upon a large
number of people and under different conditions of life, in
order to avoid so far as possible the influence of personal
idiosyncrasy and thereby escape misleading conclusions.</p>

<p>The experiments have been conducted with three distinct
types or classes of individuals:</p>

<p>1st. A group of five men of varying ages, connected with
the University as professors and instructors; men who while
leading active lives have not engaged in very active muscular
work. They were selected as representatives of the mental
worker rather than the physical worker, although several of
them in the performance of their daily duties had to be on
their feet in the laboratory a good portion of the day.</p>

<p>2d. A detail of thirteen men, volunteers from the Hospital
Corps of the United States Army and representatives of the
moderate worker; men who for a period of six months took
each week day a vigorous amount of systematic exercise in the
gymnasium, in addition to the routine work connected with
their daily life as members of the United States Hospital
Corps. These men were of different nationalities, ages, and
temperaments.</p>

<p>3d. A group of eight young men, students in the University,
all thoroughly trained athletes, and some of them with
exceptional records in athletic events.</p>

</div>

<p>Before proceeding with a detailed account of the experimental
work, it may be well again to emphasize that what is especially
desired is to ascertain how far, if any, the intake of
proteid food can be diminished without detriment to the body,
<i>i. e.</i>, with maintenance of nitrogen and body equilibrium and
without impairment of bodily and mental vigor. Further, if
a lower proteid standard than that generally adopted can be
established, it is desirable to ascertain whether it can be maintained
indefinitely, or for a long period of time, without loss
of strength and vigor. Obviously, it is of primary importance
that we should know quite definitely what the minimal proteid
requirement of the healthy man per kilo of body-weight really
is, and the experimental work about to be detailed has aimed
especially to determine whether it is possible to materially
lower the amount of daily proteid food, without detriment to
the bodily health and with maintenance of physical and mental
vigor.</p>

<p>The writer, fully impressed with his responsibility in the
conduct of an experiment of this kind, began with himself in
November, 1902. At that time he weighed 65 kilos, was
nearly 47 years of age, and accustomed to eating daily an
amount of food approximately equal to the so-called dietary
standards. Recognizing that the habits of a lifetime should
not be too suddenly changed, a gradual reduction was made in
the amount of proteid or albuminous food taken each day.
In the writer’s case, this resulted in the course of a month or
two in the complete abolition of breakfast, except for a small
cup of coffee. A light lunch was taken at 1.30 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, followed
by a heavier dinner at 6.30 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> Occasionally, however, the
heartier meal was taken at noontime, as the appetite suggested.
It should be added that the total intake of food was gradually
diminished, as well as the proteid constituents. There was
no change, however, to a vegetable diet, but a simple introduction
of physiological economy. Still, there was and is now a
distinct tendency toward the exclusion of meat in some measure,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
the appetite not calling for this form of food in the same
degree as formerly. At first, this change to a smaller amount
of food daily was attended with some discomfort, but this soon
passed away, and the writer’s interest in the subject was augmented
by the discovery that he was unquestionably in improved
physical condition. A rheumatic trouble in the knee
joint, which had persisted for a year and a half and which only
partially responded to treatment, entirely disappeared (and has
never recurred since). Minor troubles, such as “sick headaches”
and bilious attacks, no longer appeared periodically as
before. There was greater appreciation of such food as was
eaten; a keener appetite and a more acute taste seemed to be
developed, with a more thorough liking for simple foods. By
June, 1903, the body-weight had fallen to 58 kilos.</p>

<p>During the summer the same simple diet was persisted in—a
small cup of coffee for breakfast, a fairly substantial dinner
at midday and a light supper at night. Two months were
spent in Maine at an inland fishing resort, and during a part
of this time a guide was dispensed with and the boat rowed
by the writer frequently six to ten miles in a forenoon, sometimes
against head winds (without breakfast), and with much
greater freedom from fatigue and muscular soreness than in
previous years on a fuller dietary. The test of endurance and
fitness for physical work which the writer thus carried out
“on an empty stomach” tended to strengthen the opinion
that it is a mistake to assume the necessity for a hearty meal
because heavy work is about to be done. It is certainly far
more rational from a physiological standpoint to leave the
hearty meal until the day’s work is accomplished. We seemingly
forget that the energy of muscular contraction comes
not from the food-stuffs present at the time in the stomach
and intestinal tract, but rather from the absorbed material
stored up in the muscles and which was digested and absorbed
a day or two before. Further, it is to be remembered that the
very process of digestion draws to the gastro-intestinal tract a
large supply of blood, and that a large amount of energy is
needed for the processes of secretion, digestion, absorption, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
peristalsis, which are of necessity incited by the presence of
food in the stomach and intestine, thereby actually diminishing
the amount of energy available at the place where it is
most needed. Why, then, draw upon the resources of the body
just at a time, or slightly prior to the time, when the work we
desire to perform, either muscular or mental, calls for a copious
blood supply in muscle or brain, and when all available energy
is needed for the task that is to be accomplished?</p>

<p>We are too wont to compare the working body with a machine,
the boiler, engine, etc., overlooking the fact that the
animal mechanism differs from the machine in at least one important
respect. When we desire to set machinery in operation
we must get up steam, and so a fire is started under the
boiler and steam is generated in proportion as fuel is burned.
The source of the energy made use of in moving the machinery
is the extraneous combustible material introduced into the
fire-box, but the energy of muscular contraction, for example,
comes not from the oxidizable food material in the stomach,
but from the material of the muscle itself. In other words, in
the animal body it is a part of the tissue framework, or material
that is closely incorporated with the framework, that is
burned up, and the ability to endure continued muscular strain
depends upon the nutritive condition of the muscles involved,
and not upon the amount of food contained in, or introduced
into, the stomach. All physiologists will, I think, acknowledge
the soundness of this reasoning, but how few of us apply the
principle in practice. It is perfectly logical to begin the work
of the day with a comparatively empty stomach,—after we
have once freed ourselves from the habit of a hearty breakfast,—and
in the writer’s experience both mental and physical
work have become the easier from this change of habit. The
muscle and the brain are given opportunity to repair the waste
they have undergone, by the taking of food at times when the
digestive processes will not draw upon the energy that in
activity is needed elsewhere.</p>

<p>Further, it is easy to understand why on a restricted diet,
especially of proteid foods, there should be a diminished sense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
of fatigue in connection with vigorous or continued muscular
work, and why at the same time there should be an increased
power of endurance, with actual increase of strength. With
a diminished intake of proteid food there is a decreased formation
of crystalline nitrogenous waste products, such as
uric acid and the purin bases, to say nothing of other bodies
less fully known, which circulating through the system are
undoubtedly responsible, in part at least, for what we term
fatigue. We need not consider here whether the sense of
fatigue is due to an action of these substances upon the
muscles themselves, upon the motor nerves or their end-plates,
or upon the central nervous system; it is enough for
the present purpose to emphasize the probable results of their
presence in undue amount. Lastly, we may emphasize what
is pretty clearly evident to-day, viz., that the energy of muscular
contraction comes preferably from the oxidation, not of
the nitrogenous or proteid constituents of the muscles, but
of the non-nitrogenous components of the tissue; another
reason why excess of proteid food may be advantageously
avoided. Moreover, proteid food stimulates body metabolism
in general, and hence undue amounts of proteid in the diet
augment unnecessarily the metabolism or combustion of the
non-nitrogenous material of the muscle, thereby destroying
what would otherwise be preserved as a source of energy in
muscular contraction, when the muscles are called upon for
the performance of their daily functions.</p>

<p>On the writer’s return to New Haven in the fall of 1903,
he was surprised to find that his body-weight was practically
the same as early in July. In the period between November,
1902, and July, 1903, the body had lost 8 kilos under the
gradual change of diet, but from July to October, 1903, the
weight had apparently remained stationary, from which it
might fairly be assumed that the body had finally adjusted
itself to the new conditions.</p>

<p>What now was the condition of the body as regards nitrogen
metabolism? To answer this question the entire twenty-four
hours’ urine was collected practically every day, from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
October 13, 1903, to June 28, 1904, representing a period of
nearly nine months. This daily output through the kidneys
was analyzed each day with special reference to the total
nitrogen,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> as a measure of the amount of proteid material
metabolized. Total volume of the urine, specific gravity, uric
acid, phosphoric acid, indican, and other points were also
considered, the more important results being indicated in the
following tables.</p>

<p>Scrutiny of the tables shows that during this period of nine
months the body-weight was practically constant. The daily
volume of urine was exceptionally small and fairly regular in
amount, the average daily output for the nine months being
468 c.c. It is a noticeable fact that with a diminished intake
of proteid food there is far less thirst, and consequently a
greatly decreased demand for water or other fluids. Further,
in view of the small nitrogenous waste there is no need on
the part of the body for any large amount of fluid to flush out
the kidneys. The writer has not had a turbid urine during
the nine months’ period. With heavier eating of nitrogenous
foods, an abundant water supply is a necessity to prevent the
kidneys from becoming clogged, thereby explaining the frequent
beneficial results of the copious libations of mineral<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
waters, spring waters, etc., frequently called for after, or with,
heavy eating. Obviously, a small volume of urine each day
means so much less wear and tear of the delicate mechanism
of the kidneys. Somewhat noticeable, in a general way, is
the apparent relationship between the volume of the urine
and the nitrogen output, in harmony with the well-known
diuretic action of urea. The specific gravity of the urine
shows variation only within narrow limits, the daily average
for the nine months being 1027.</p>

<p>Uric acid is noticeably small in quantity, the average daily
output for the nine months’ period, based upon the determinations
made, being only 0.392 gram.</p>

<p>Chief interest, however, centres around the figures for total
nitrogen, since these figures give for each day the extent of
the proteid metabolism; <i>i. e.</i>, the amount of proteid material
broken down in the body each day in connection with the wear
and tear of the bodily machinery. To fully grasp the significance
of these data, it should be remembered that the
prevalent dietary standards are based upon the assumption
that the average adult must metabolize each day at least 16
grams of nitrogen. Indeed, that is what actual analysis of
the urine indicates in most cases. If now we look carefully
through the figures shown in the above tables, covering a
period from October 13, 1903, to June 28, 1904, it is seen
that the daily nitrogen excretion is far different from 16
grams. Indeed, the figures for nitrogen are exceedingly low,
and, moreover, they vary little from day to day. The average
daily output of nitrogen through the urine for the entire
period of nearly nine months is only 5.699 grams.</p>

<p>For the first six months the average daily excretion
amounted to 5.82 grams of nitrogen, while from April 12
to June 28 the average daily excretion of nitrogen was 5.40
grams, thus showing a slight tendency downward. On the
whole, however, there is shown a somewhat remarkable uniformity
in the daily excretion. Thus, the average daily excretion
for the month of November was 5.79 grams of nitrogen,
for the month of March 5.66 grams, thus showing very little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
difference in the output of nitrogen through the kidneys in
these two periods, three months apart. In other words, the
extent of proteid katabolism was essentially the same throughout
the entire nine months, implying that the amount of proteid
food eaten must have been fairly constant, and that the
body had adapted itself to this new level of nutrition from
which there was no tendency to deviate. There was no
weighing out of food and no attempt to follow any specified
diet. The greatest possible variety of simple foods was
indulged in, and the dictates of the appetite were followed
with the single precaution that excess was avoided. In other
words, it was temperance in diet, and not prohibition. Yet
it is equally true, in the writer’s case at least, that the appetite
itself unconsciously served as a regulator, since there
was, as a rule, no necessity to hold the appetite in check to
avoid excess. Doubtless, the writer’s knowledge of the general
composition of food-stuffs has had some influence in the
choice of foods, and thereby aided in bringing about this
somewhat remarkable uniformity in the daily output of nitrogen
for such a long period of time on an unrestricted diet.</p>

<p>What now do the nitrogen figures show regarding the
amount of proteid material metabolized each day? It will
be remembered that the Voit standard calls for 118 grams of
proteid or albuminous food daily, of which 105 grams should
be absorbable, in order to maintain the body in a condition
of nitrogen equilibrium, and in a state of physical vigor and
general tone. This would mean a daily excretion through
the urine of at least 16 grams of nitrogen. The daily output
of nitrogen in the case under discussion, however, was 5.699
grams for a period of nearly nine months. This amount of
nitrogen excreted through the urine means only 35.6 grams
of proteid metabolized, or about one-third the amount called
for by the Voit standard, or the standards generally adopted
as expressing man’s daily requirement of proteid food. But
was the body in nitrogenous equilibrium on this small amount
of proteid food? Naturally, this question might be answered
in the affirmative, on the basis of the constancy in body-weight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
for the period from October to June, but more decisive
proof is needed. The question was therefore settled
by a careful comparison of the income and output, in which
all the food eaten was carefully weighed and analyzed, while
the nitrogen of the urine and fæces was determined with
equal accuracy. The first experiment of this character to
be quoted is for the week commencing March 20, a period
of six days.</p>

<p>Following are the diets made use of each day, the weights
of the various food-stuffs being given in grams. Likewise is
shown the nitrogen content of the several food-stuffs for each
day, and also a comparison of the nitrogen intake with the
output of nitrogen through the urine:</p>

<p>Examination of the results shown in the foregoing balance
makes it quite clear that the body was essentially in nitrogenous
equilibrium. Indeed, there was a slight plus balance,
showing that even with the small intake of proteid food the
body was storing up nitrogen at the rate of 0.16 gram per
day. The average daily intake of nitrogen for the six days’
period was 6.40 grams, equal to 40.0 grams of proteid or
albuminous food. The average daily output of nitrogen
through the urine and fæces was 6.24 grams. The average
daily output of nitrogen through the urine for the six days’
period was 5.44 grams, corresponding to the metabolism of 34
grams of proteid material. When these figures are contrasted
with the usually accepted standards of proteid requirement for
the healthy man, they are certainly somewhat impressive,
especially when it is remembered that the body at that date
had been in essentially this same condition for at least six
months, and probably for an entire year. The Voit standard of
118 grams of proteid, with an equivalent of at least 18 grams
of nitrogen and calling for the metabolism of 105 grams of
proteid, or 16.5 grams of nitrogen per day, makes clear how
great a physiological economy had been accomplished. In
other words, the consumption of proteid food was reduced to
at least one-third the daily amount generally considered as
representing the average requirement of the healthy man, and
this with maintenance of body-weight at practically a constant
point for the preceding ten months, and, so far as the writer
can observe, with no loss of vigor, capacity for mental and
physical work, or endurance. Indeed, the writer is disposed
to maintain that he has done more work and led a more active
life in every way during the period of this experiment, and
with greater comfort and less fatigue than usual. His health
has certainly been of the best during this period.</p>

<p>In this connection it may be well to call attention to the
completeness of the utilization of the daily food in this six
days’ experiment, as shown by the small amount of refuse discharged
per rectum, indicating as it does the high efficiency of
the digestive processes and of the processes of absorption.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
The refuse matter for the entire period of six days amounted
when dry to only 74 grams, and when it is remembered how
large a proportion of this refuse must of necessity be composed
of the cast-off secretions from the body, it will be seen
how thorough must have been the utilization of the food by
the system. The loss of nitrogen to the body per day
through the fæces amounted to only 0.79 gram, and this on
a mixed diet containing considerable matter not especially
concentrated, and on some days with noticeable amounts of
food, such as salads, not particularly digestible.</p>

<p>Finally, emphasis should be laid upon the fact that this
economy of proteid food, this establishment of nitrogen equilibrium
on a low proteid intake, was accomplished without
increase in the daily intake of non-nitrogenous foods. In
fact, the amount of fats and carbohydrates was likewise
greatly reduced, far below the minimal standard of 3000 calories
as representing the potential energy or fuel value of the
daily diet. Indeed, during the balance period of six days just
described the average fuel value of the food per day was only
a little over 1600 calories.</p>

<p>As the experiment continued and the record for the months
of April and May was obtained, it became evident from the
nitrogen results that the rate of proteid katabolism was being
still more reduced. A second balance experiment was therefore
tried with a view to seeing if the body was still in nitrogen
equilibrium, and also to ascertain whether the fuel value
of the food still showed the same low calorific power. For
a period of five days, June 23 to 27, the intake of food and
the entire output were carefully compared, with the results
shown in the accompanying tables.</p>

<p>Examination of these figures makes quite clear that the
body was still in nitrogen equilibrium, or essentially so, the
minus balance being so small as to have little significance.
The body-weight was still stationary, and yet during this
balance period the average daily intake of nitrogen was only
5.86 grams, corresponding to 36.62 grams of proteid or albuminous
food. Further, the average daily fuel value of the
food was only 1549 calories, a trifle less than in the preceding
period. The average daily output of nitrogen through the
urine for this period was 4.92 grams, corresponding to the
metabolism of 30.7 grams of proteid food. Hence, the results
of this period confirm those of the preceding period and make
it quite clear that this subject, with a body-weight of 57.5
kilos, can be maintained in body equilibrium, and in nitrogen
equilibrium, on a daily diet containing only 5.8 grams of nitrogen
and with a fuel value of about 1600 calories. Under
these conditions, as in the last balance period, the daily amount
of nitrogen metabolized was very small, averaging only 4.92
grams. Comparison of this figure with the accepted standard
of 16 grams of nitrogen makes quite clear the extent of the
physiological economy which is attainable by the body, and
emphasizes also the extent of the unnecessary and worse than
useless labor put upon the body by the prevalent dietetic
habits of the majority of mankind.</p>

<p>It is of course understood that the low fuel value which
sufficed to keep the writer in body equilibrium would not
meet the requirements of a more active life, with greater physical
labor. The writer has led a very busy life during the
year of this experiment, but it has been mental activity rather
than physical, although doubtless he has exercised as much
as the ordinary professional worker not accustomed to athletic
sports. The results of the experiment, however, make it quite
clear that a man of the above body-weight, even though he
lead a very active life—not involving great physical labor—can
maintain his body in equilibrium indefinitely with an intake
of 36 to 40 grams of proteid or albuminous food, and with
a total fuel value of about 1600 calories. Further, it is to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
understood that there is no special form of diet involved in
the accomplishment of such a result. Scrutiny of the daily
diet, tabulated in the two balance periods, will show the character
of the food made use of. Personal likes and dislikes
must naturally enter into the choice of any diet, and freedom
of choice, freedom to follow the dictates of one’s appetite,
with such regulation as comes from the use of reason and intelligence,
are all that is necessary to secure the desired end.
Physiological economy in nutrition is easily attainable and
does not involve the adoption of vegetarianism. It does
mean, however, temperance and simplicity in diet, coupled
with intelligent regulation, which, however, soon becomes a
habit and eventually leads to a moderation in diet which fully
satisfies all the cravings of appetite as completely as it suffices
to maintain the body in equilibrium and in a general condition
of health and vigor.</p>

<p>Taking the data recorded above, we may now calculate the
nitrogen requirement of the body per kilo of body-weight.
With the body-weight placed at 57 kilos and with an average
daily elimination of nitrogen for nearly nine months of
5.699 grams, or practically 5.7 grams, it is evident that the
nitrogen metabolized per kilo of body-weight in the present
instance was exactly 0.1 gram. If we take the lower figure of
5.40 grams of nitrogen, the average daily excretion from
April 13 to June 27, we find the nitrogen requirement to be
0.0947 gram per kilo of body-weight. Translating these figures
into terms of proteid or albuminous matter, they mean the
utilization or metabolism of 0.625 gram of proteid matter daily
per kilo of body-weight, under the conditions of life, activity,
and general food consumption prevailing throughout this period
of nearly nine months with this particular individual.</p>

<p>Whether we are justified in saying that this figure represents
the <i>minimal</i> proteid requirement of this particular
individual is perhaps questionable, since the proteid or nitrogen
requirement will of necessity vary somewhat with the
amount of non-nitrogenous food consumed. Doubtless, the
nitrogen metabolism could be reduced still lower by increasing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
the intake of non-nitrogenous food, but under the above
conditions of life, following a plan of living both congenial
and satisfactory, one that fully sufficed to keep the body in
equilibrium and with the practice of a general physiological
economy, we may say that the metabolism of 0.1 gram of
nitrogen per kilo of body-weight was quite sufficient to meet
all the requirements of the body. Health, strength, mental
and physical vigor have been maintained unimpaired, and
there is a growing conviction that in many ways there is a
distinct improvement in both the physical and mental condition.
Greater freedom from fatigue, greater aptitude for
work, greater freedom from minor ailments, have gradually
become associated in the writer’s mind with this lowered
proteid metabolism and general condition of physiological
economy. The writer, however, is fully alive to the necessity
of caution in the acceptance of one’s feelings as a measure of
physical or mental condition, but he has been keenly watchful
for any and every sign or symptom during the course of these
experiments, and is now strongly of the opinion that there is
much good to be gained in the adoption of dietetic habits that
accord more closely with the true physiological needs of the
body. If a man of 57 kilos body-weight can maintain a condition
of equilibrium, with continuance of health, strength,
and vigor (to say nothing of possible improvement), with a
daily consumption of say 40 grams of proteid food and sufficient
non-nitrogenous food to yield 2000 calories, why should
he load up his system each day with three times this amount
of proteid food, with enough more fat and carbohydrate to
yield 3000 plus calories?</p>

<p>Finally, the writer in summing up his own experience is inclined
to say that while he entered upon this experiment simply
with a view to studying the question from a purely scientific
and physiological standpoint, he has become so deeply impressed
with the great gain to the body by this practice of
physiological economy, and his system has become so accustomed
to the new level of nutrition that there is no desire to
return to the more liberal dietetic habits of former years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p class="tb">Obviously, it is not wise nor safe to draw too broad deductions
from a single individual, nor from a single experiment
even though it extends over a long period of time; consequently,
we may turn our attention to other individuals with
presumably different personality and different habits of life.
The writer’s colleague, Dr. Lafayette B. Mendel, Professor of
Physiological Chemistry in the Sheffield Scientific School,
kindly volunteered to become a subject of experiment. With
a body-weight of 76 kilos, 32 years of age, and of strong
physique, he commenced to modify his diet about the middle
of October, 1903, diminishing gradually the amount of proteid
food with the results shown in the following tables, where are
given, as in the preceding experiment, the amounts of nitrogen
in the urine, as a measure of the quantity of proteid metabolized,
uric acid, and other factors of interest in this connection.</p>

<p>The collection of data commenced on October 26, 1903.
During some weeks the urine of each day was not analyzed by
itself, but an aliquot part was taken from the 24 hours’ quantity,
and at the end of a week the determinations were made
on the mixture, thereby giving the average daily composition
for the period. With Dr. Mendel, as in the writer’s case, there
was no prescribing of food, but perfect freedom of choice.
The appetite was satisfied each day, but with a gradual diminution
of proteid food, especially of meat. Dr. Mendel appeared
to accomplish the desired end best by keeping up a
liberal allowance of non-nitrogenous food, and the total potential
energy of the daily diet was not so greatly diminished as
in the writer’s case. In other words, he appeared to need more
food, but succeeded without great effort in reducing the proteid
intake to nearly as low a level as in the preceding experiment.
For the period of three months from January 4
to April 3, 1904, the average daily excretion of nitrogen
amounted to 6.46 grams, which means the metabolism of 40.37
grams of proteid or albuminous food per day for this quarter
of the year.</p>

<p>From November 10, 1903, to June 23, 1904, a period of
about seven months and a half, the average daily excretion of
nitrogen through the urine was 6.53 grams. In other words,
throughout this long period the average daily amount of proteid
matter metabolized was 40.8 grams, only a little more than
one-third the amount called for by the Voit standard. Until
February, the body-weight gradually fell, but from the early
part of February until the end of the experiment the body-weight
remained practically stationary at 70 kilos. Dr. Mendel,
however, from the necessities of his daily work in the
laboratory was compelled to a much greater degree of physical
activity than the subject of the preceding experiment, and consequently
required a larger amount of non-nitrogenous food
than the latter. Further, owing to his greater physical activity
and the necessary variations in this daily activity, it was
not so easy at first to attain equilibrium.</p>

<p>On February 9, a balance experiment of six days was commenced,
with a careful comparison of the nitrogen intake and
output. In the accompanying tables are shown all of the
data. By scrutiny of these it will be seen that Dr. Mendel had
adopted essentially a vegetarian diet. During this period of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
six days, however, he was not in nitrogen equilibrium, neither
was he strictly in body equilibrium, since there was a distinct
tendency for the body to fall off in weight. In this connection
it may be mentioned that there is always a tendency during
a balance experiment of this character for the subject to
eat less than he is ordinarily accustomed to, owing to the
tediousness of weighing every particle of food consumed.
Further, for the same reason, and to avoid excess of chemical
work in the analysis of samples of food, he is inclined to
limit his diet to a few articles and thereby unconsciously
restricts his intake of food, sometimes disastrously so.</p>

<p>In this balance period of six days the average daily intake
of nitrogen was 7.83 grams, coupled with an average fuel value
of the food per day of 1975 calories. This latter value was
obviously too small for a man of Dr. Mendel’s body-weight,
and doing the amount of physical work he was called upon to
perform. Being on one’s feet in a laboratory six to eight
hours a day, in addition to the ordinary activity of a vigorous
man leading a strenuous life, necessitates the utilization and
oxidation of considerable food material. The average daily
output of nitrogen through the urine amounted to 7.50 grams,
considerably above the average daily excretion for the seven
months’ period. Still, under these conditions there was a
minus balance of 7.13 grams of nitrogen for the six days’
period, indicating that the body was drawing upon its stock of
proteid material to the extent of 1.19 grams of nitrogen per
day. This does not necessarily mean that the body had need
of that additional amount of proteid matter each day, but
rather that the amount of total energy required was beyond
the potential energy supplied by the food. There not being
sufficient non-nitrogenous food at hand, the body was compelled
to draw upon its own resources, and in so doing utilized
some of its tissue proteid. This is made quite clear by the
results of the second balance period shortly to be described.</p>

<p>It is evident, however, that while the body was not in nitrogen
equilibrium for this particular period of six days, there
must have been a general condition of both body and nitrogen
equilibrium, otherwise the body-weight would not have remained
practically stationary for so long a period as from
February 7 to June 20.</p>

<p>Commencing May 18, a second nitrogen balance was attempted,
in which, as in the preceding case, there was a careful
comparison of income and output for seven days. There
was as before a free choice of food, but it was essentially
vegetable in character. A greater variety of foods was taken,
however, and an effort was made to have the non-nitrogenous
food somewhat more liberal in amount, though in as close
harmony as possible with the desires of the appetite.</p>

<p>In this period of seven days the average daily intake of
nitrogen was 8.192 grams, or only 0.36 gram per day more
than in the first balance period, while the average fuel value of
the food amounted to 2448 calories per day. Yet the average
daily output of nitrogen through the urine for this period
was 6.31 grams, or 1.2 grams per day less than in the first
balance experiment. Further, under the conditions of this
balance experiment, the body was laying up 0.380 gram of
nitrogen per day, <i>i. e.</i>, showing a plus balance of 2.66 grams
of nitrogen for the seven days’ period. Again, it is to be
noted that the average daily amount of nitrogen metabolized,
6.31 grams, was 0.22 gram less than the average daily nitrogen
excretion for the entire seven months’ period, 6.53 grams.
Evidently, this subject was quite able to maintain nitrogen
equilibrium with a metabolism of only 6.31 grams of nitrogen
per day, on a daily diet having a fuel value of about 2400
calories. Indeed, taking into account the amount of the
plus nitrogen balance, it is evident that the daily food was
somewhat in excess of the real requirements of the body,
under the then existing conditions of body-weight and bodily
activity.</p>

<p>Again, we would call attention to the thorough utilization
of the food in this experiment, emphasizing at the same time
the voluminous character of the diet, together with its largely
vegetable nature. The contrast between the diet made use
of by Dr. Mendel and that used by the subject of the first
experiment is quite striking, since the latter employed a
much more concentrated diet with an average fuel value of
only 1600 calories. Yet with a total intake of 57.343 grams
of nitrogen for the seven days of Dr. Mendel’s balance period,
10.5 grams only passed out through the rectum, or 18.3 per
cent, while in the second nitrogen balance of the first subject,
with the more concentrated diet, 17.1 per cent of the total
ingested nitrogen appeared in the fæces. In view of the
great divergence in the character and volume of the intake,
it is rather remarkable there should be so little difference in
the relative utilization of the two diets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>Finally, taking the average daily excretion of nitrogen
through the kidneys from November 10 to June 23, as a
measure of the nitrogen metabolized daily, viz., 6.53 grams,
and taking the body-weight at 70 kilos, it is plain to see that
the nitrogen metabolized per kilo of body-weight throughout
this experiment was 0.093 gram, closely similar to the result
obtained with the first subject. In other words, both of these
subjects, though widely different in body-weight, under different
degrees of physical activity, and living on different
forms of diet, seemingly required for the maintenance of
equilibrium essentially the same amount of nitrogen per
kilo of body-weight; viz., with the first subject 0.0947 gram,
if we take the lower figure of the last two months, and 0.093
gram with the second subject.</p>

<p>Regarding the fuel value of the daily food, Dr. Mendel
with a body-weight of 70 kilos, during the second balance
period, apparently utilized on an average 34.9 calories per
kilo of body-weight daily, while the first subject, of 57 kilos
body-weight, made use of only 28 calories per kilo. The fuel
value of the daily food must, however, as is well known, vary
greatly with differing degrees of physical activity, from which
arises the necessity for corresponding variation in the amounts
of non-nitrogenous foods ingested.</p>

<p class="tb">Dr. Frank P. Underhill, instructor in physiological chemistry
in the Sheffield Scientific School, is another subject of
experiment who volunteered to study on himself the effects
of a lowered proteid intake. Prior to the experiment he was
in the habit of eliminating from 16 to 16.5 grams of nitrogen
per day through the kidneys, representing the usual 105
grams of proteid food metabolized.</p>

<p>Dr. Underhill, at the beginning of the experiment, July 1,
1903, was twenty-six years of age and weighed 67.6 kilos.
For a period of two weeks, from July 14 to August 2, he
gradually reduced the intake of proteid food as well as the
total amount of food consumed, doing this in part by diminishing
the quantity eaten at breakfast, and in smaller measure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
at the two other meals of the day. During this period
of two weeks, the urine and fæces were analyzed with the
results shown in the accompanying table. Regarding the
extent of proteid metabolism, it will be seen that the nitrogen
content of the urine fell from 14.28 grams per day down to
5 to 6 grams per day. Having reached this level, the subject
maintained it throughout the summer of 1903, occasional
analyses being made to demonstrate the level of nitrogen
excretion.</p>

<p>In connection with the accompanying table of results,
attention is called to the composition of the fæces with
special reference to their content of nitrogen. The point to
be emphasized is the gradual increase in the percentage content
of fæcal nitrogen, associated with the changed diet and
the general diminution of food intake. This is well illustrated
by the following figures, giving the percentage of
nitrogen in the dry fæces for the three periods of July 14-21,
July 22-30, and August 11-13:</p>

<p>The diminished amount of fæcal discharge means naturally
not only a smaller intake of food, but implies also a greater
utilization of the food ingested, and as a result the increased
percentage of nitrogen in the discharges shows itself because
of the relatively larger preponderance of nitrogenous secretions
from the intestinal tract.</p>

<p>The latter part of September, 1903, Dr. Underhill attempted
to return to his original methods of living, but found difficulty
in consuming the daily quantities of food he had formerly
been in the habit of taking. From October 11 to
October 25, 1903, however, he raised the consumption of
proteid food to such a degree that the nitrogen excretion
through the urine averaged from 10 to 12 grams per day.
After this date he fell back to the lower proteid intake, and
from that period to June 23, 1904, he maintained a low level
of proteid metabolism without detriment to his bodily vigor,
and, as he believes, with a distinct betterment.</p>

<p>The following tables of results extending from October 11,
1903, to June 23, 1904, show the data collected.</p>

<p>It will be seen by a study of the analytical data that Dr.
Underhill had an average daily excretion of nitrogen through
the kidneys from October 26, 1903, to June 23, 1904, of 7.43
grams. From October 26 to April 13, a period of nearly six
months, the average daily excretion was 7.81 grams of nitrogen,
while from the latter date to June 23 the average daily
excretion amounted to 6.68 grams of nitrogen. Taking the
body-weight at 65 kilos, the lower nitrogen figure would mean
a metabolism of 0.102 gram of nitrogen per kilo of body-weight,
closely akin to the figures obtained with the two
preceding subjects.</p>

<p>An excretion of 6.68 grams of nitrogen corresponds to the
metabolism of 41.75 grams of proteid matter, while the excretion
of 7.43 grams of nitrogen implies the metabolism of 46.4
grams of proteid, being less than one-half the ordinarily accepted
requirement for the healthy adult.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>During this long period of eight months the body-weight
was stationary, carrying with it the assumption that the body
was in a condition of nitrogen equilibrium. It should be
emphasized in connection with Dr. Underhill’s case, that
throughout the entire period of eight months, and more,
there was perfect freedom in the choice of food. Further,
it will be noticed by a study of the dietary made use of in
the balance experiments that Dr. Underhill did not reduce
his nitrogen intake by any exclusion of meat. He practically
made use of his ordinary diet, such as he had always been accustomed
to, but with a decided diminution of the amount of
proteid food, accompanied by a gradual reduction in the total
amount of food consumed each day. His diet, therefore, was
in no sense a vegetable diet. Meat was conspicuous in his
daily food, but naturally in reduced quantities.</p>

<p>On February 9 a nitrogen balance was attempted, in which
a careful comparison of the nitrogen content of all intake
and output was made for a period of six days. By a study
of the results of this balance period, shown in the accompanying
tables, it will be noticed that not only was there
no deficiency of nitrogen, but the body was laying on nitrogen
at the rate of 0.158 gram per day. Further, it will
be observed that the fuel value of the food per day averaged
only a little over 2000 calories. Yet this amount of food,
with its comparatively low fuel value, carried with it only
8.83 grams of nitrogen per day. Upon this quantity of food
the body was able to maintain itself, with a little nitrogen
to spare and with sufficient fuel value in the food to supply
all the energy required for muscular contraction, mental
effort, and the maintenance of body temperature.</p>

<p>On June 1, near the close of the experiment, a second nitrogen
balance was attempted, with a view to seeing if under
the existing conditions of life and activity it was possible to
reduce the fuel value of the food, and at the same time diminish
in still greater measure the quantity of proteid food taken.
The results of this trial are seen in the accompanying tables,
where for four days a careful comparison of output and intake
is shown. It will be observed from these tables that the average
fuel value of the food per day was reduced to 1785 calories,
and that the average intake of nitrogen was restricted to
6.73 grams per day. The balance shown is a minus balance,
although the deficiency per diem is not large. It is very
obvious that both the nitrogen and fuel value of the food
can be reduced considerably below the average maintained
during the period of the first balance, but not to the degree
attempted in the second balance, and secure nitrogen or body
equilibrium. It will be noted in this last nitrogen balance,
that the average daily output of nitrogen through the urine
amounted to 6.46 grams, while the average nitrogen intake
was 6.73 grams. The fuel value of the food, however, averaged
only 1785 calories per day. It is quite evident, if the
non-nitrogenous food had not been reduced quite so much,
that a plus nitrogen balance would have been obtained. Still,
it is obvious that under the conditions of life and activity,
this subject needed to metabolize only about 40 grams of
proteid per day, with the total fuel value of his food equal to
about 2000 calories, in order to secure both body and nitrogen
equilibrium. Here, again, we have an illustration of the possibility
of physiological economy which shows itself in a reduction
of the daily proteid food more than 50 per cent, with
a reduction of the non-nitrogenous food fully 30 per cent, and
with maintenance of health, strength and vigor equal, if not
superior, to that which the subject has ever experienced.</p>

<p class="tb">Dr. Arthur L. Dean, Instructor in Plant Physiology in the
Sheffield Scientific School, twenty-five years of age, and
weighing 64 kilos, likewise became a subject of study in this
investigation. He is a man of strong physique, and as an
undergraduate student at Harvard University trained for various
athletic events. He began on the experiment October 13,
1903, and continued until April 3, 1904. From October 13th
to October 27 he followed his usual dietary habits, simply
reducing in some measure the amount of food consumed.
During this period of fifteen days, the average excretion of
nitrogen per day through the kidneys was about 12 grams.
On the 28th of October he began to reduce in still greater
measure the amount of proteid food eaten, and gradually
diminished the extent of his proteid metabolism, although not
to the same degree as the preceding subjects. He had full
freedom of choice in the character and quantity of his diet, but
his food was characterized by a predominance of vegetable
matter, with an almost complete exclusion of meat.</p>

<p>For a period of nearly six months, or more exactly, from
October 28 to April 3, the average daily output of nitrogen
through the kidneys amounted to 8.99 grams, while the average
daily output of uric acid was 0.386 gram. This daily
excretion of 8.99 grams of nitrogen implies a metabolism of
56.18 grams of proteid. This, to be sure, means a reduction
in proteid metabolism of about 50 per cent, as compared with
the Voit and other standards, but does not show an economy
equal to that practised by the preceding subjects. It is to be
noted, however, in Dr. Dean’s case, that the body-weight did
not show at any time in the experiment a tendency to diminish.
In fact, all through the experiment his body-weight was
a little higher than at the beginning.</p>

<p>On February 9, a nitrogen balance was attempted, when
for a period of six days a careful comparison of intake and
output of nitrogen was made. The results show that while
during this period of six days 52.999 grams of nitrogen were
ingested, there was an output through the urine and fæces of
61.13 grams of nitrogen, thus indicating a minus balance for this
period of 1.355 grams of nitrogen per day. The average daily
intake of nitrogen was 8.83 grams. The average daily output
of nitrogen through the kidneys was 8.77 grams, being 0.22
gram less than the average daily excretion through the kidneys
for the six months’ period. The fuel value of the food for this
period averaged 2529 calories per day. The nitrogen balance,
however, is so strikingly a minus balance that we are forced to
conclude the above quantities of food were not quite sufficient
to meet the needs of the body under the then existing conditions.
Still, the fact that the body-weight during the entire
period of six months showed no tendency downward implies
that during this longer period the body must have been essentially
in nitrogen equilibrium, under conditions whereby there
was a metabolism of only 56 grams of proteid per day. As
before stated, this means a physiological economy, as contrasted
with existing standards, of about 50 per cent in proteid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
food. So far as was to be seen, the bodily strength and
vigor of the subject, like his body-weight, were fully maintained
under the restricted diet, but, for some reason, he did
not apparently take as kindly to a reduction of proteid food,
and did not accomplish so great a lowering in the rate of proteid
metabolism.</p>

<p>Following are the data of the balance experiment:</p>

<p class="center" id="contents11"><i>Tuesday, February 9, 1904.</i></p>

<p class="hanging">Breakfast.—Coffee 210 grams, bread 38.5 grams, oatmeal 127 grams, cream 92

<p class="tb">Mr. George M. Beers, Clerk in the Treasurer’s office of the
Sheffield Scientific School, became a subject of study in January,
1903. Mr. Beers was thirty-eight years of age, and had
always enjoyed fairly good health, although of somewhat frail
physique. His occupation has always been indoor work as
accountant, etc. His body-weight was 61 kilos.</p>

<p>Mr. Beers came to the writer for advice as to possible ways
of improving his general health, and when it was learned that
he was in the habit of eating large amounts of meat, the suggestion
was made to him that it might be wise to ascertain the
effect of a diminished quantity of proteid food, and as a result
of this advice Mr. Beers began to cut down the amount of
meat consumed daily. The effect of this abstention from
meat was so noticeable that voluntarily all meat was withdrawn
from his diet. With this change in dietary habits there
came about a loss of body-weight, which, however, was soon
regained.</p>

<p>Commencing with May 14, 1903, the amount of nitrogen
excreted from the kidneys was determined from time to time,
but not each day, since it was very soon found that Mr. Beers
showed great regularity in his dietary habits, and a corresponding
regularity in the composition of the output. This
regularity was due in large measure to the fact that the subject
became, for the time at least, practically a vegetarian.
The beneficial effects noted in his own experience with abstention
from meat led to his voluntarily excluding it from his
daily diet, so that from January, 1903, to June, 1904, the subject
practically tasted meat, fish, or eggs on only four occasions,
namely, the 26th day of November, 1903, May 19, 20, and 21,
1904. With this limitation to a vegetable diet and with regular
methods of living, the nitrogenous waste material was
found to be constant within very narrow limits. Emphasis,
however, should be laid upon the fact that there was no prescription
of diet, but perfect freedom of choice, although this
choice was limited wholly to vegetable and cereal foods.</p>

<p>The accompanying tables give the output of nitrogen, uric
acid, etc., through the kidneys for various dates between May<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
14, 1903, and June 15, 1904. Scrutiny of these tables shows
that the average daily output of nitrogen, so far as the data
show, amounted to 8.58 grams. This indicates an average
daily metabolism of 53.62 grams of proteid material.</p>

<p>Likewise noticeable is the perfectly steady body-weight
throughout this whole period of time, while the low level of
8.5 grams of metabolized nitrogen testifies to an economy in
the use of proteid food, which indicates that in this subject at
least the needs of the body for proteid food could easily be
met by an amount equal to about one-half that called for by
the Voit and similar standard dietaries.</p>

<p>On February 9, a nitrogen balance was attempted covering
a period of six days, in which there was an exact comparison
of the nitrogen income and output. In this balance
period it will be observed that the total amount of nitrogen
taken in for the six days was 53.108 grams, while the output
of nitrogen through the kidneys amounted to 51.07 grams.
The nitrogen excreted through the fæces, however, brought
the total nitrogen output up to 58.83 grams, thus making a
minus balance for the six days of 5.722 grams of nitrogen.
During this period the average fuel value of the food per day
was 2168 calories. The average daily output of metabolized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
nitrogen during the period was 8.5 grams, practically identical
with the average daily excretion of nitrogen through the kidneys
for the entire year, so far as determined. We have
here a distinct minus balance, due either to an insufficient
amount of proteid food, or an insufficient fuel value.</p>

<p>On May 6, a second nitrogen balance was attempted
covering a period of seven days, in which, as before, there
was an exact comparison of the income and output of
nitrogen. In this period of seven days, as shown in the
accompanying tables, the fuel value of the food was essentially
the same as in the preceding period, but the amount of
proteid food was increased to an average intake of 10.10
grams per day. Under these conditions there was a distinct
plus balance for the seven days amounting to 2.425 grams,
thus showing that with this quantity of nitrogenous food the
body was laying on nitrogen to the extent of 0.346 gram per
day. The average daily amount of nitrogen metabolized
during this period was only 8.18 grams, being quite noticeably
below the average daily amount for the year. In other
words, the results of this balance period show that with a
consumption of food sufficient to yield about 2200 calories
per day, the body of this subject needed to metabolize only
8.25 grams of nitrogen per day to more than maintain nitrogen
equilibrium. Following are the tables of results:</p>

<p>Here we have, as in the preceding cases, marked physiological
economy of non-nitrogenous as well as of nitrogenous
food material. Further, taking the body-weight of the subject
as 61.5 kilos, and with an average daily excretion of
8.58 grams of metabolized nitrogen, it is evident that under
the existing conditions of life and activity there was need for
the metabolism of only 0.139 gram of nitrogen per kilo of
body-weight. Doubtless, however, still greater economy was
possible.</p>

<p>Finally, while it hardly savors of scientific accuracy to
quote simple sensations, yet it may be stated that the subject
asserts a betterment of his condition, with continuance
of mental and physical vigor in such a degree that he has
persisted now for more than a year and a half in the maintenance
of these dietetic habits which are characterized by
this lowered rate of proteid metabolism. The quantity of
nitrogen metabolized daily means the breaking down of approximately
50 grams of proteid, and it is very evident that
this amount of proteid food, one-half the amount called for
by the ordinary diet, is quite sufficient to meet all of the
subject’s bodily needs, even with a total fuel value considerably
below 2500 calories.</p>

<h3 id="contents15"><span class="smcap">Summary</span></h3>

<p>Certain general conclusions seem to be justified by the
results reported. A healthy man, whose occupation is such
as not to involve excessive muscular work, but whose activity
is mainly mental rather than physical, though by no means
excluding the latter, can live on a much smaller amount of
proteid or albuminous food than is usually considered essential
for life, without loss of mental or physical strength and
vigor, and with maintenance of body and nitrogen equilibrium.
This means that the ordinary professional man who
leads an active and even strenuous life, with its burden of
care and responsibility, need not clog his system and inhibit
his power for work by the ingestion of any such quantities
of proteid food as the ordinary dietetic standards call for.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
There is no real physiological need—that is apparent—for
the adoption of such dietetic habits as ordinarily prevail, or as
are called for by the dietary standards set by most authorities
in this branch of physiology. There is no justifiable
ground for the dictum, or the assumption, that the adult man
of average body-weight needs daily 118 grams of proteid food
for the maintenance of health, strength and vigor, or that
there is need for the metabolism of at least 16 grams of
nitrogen daily. If such were the case, how could these five
subjects, whose experiences have been detailed in the foregoing
pages, have maintained their body-weight, established
nitrogen equilibrium, pursued their ordinary vocations without
loss of strength and vigor, and kept in a perpetual condition
of good health, with an average daily metabolism of from
5.4 grams of nitrogen to 8.99 grams of nitrogen for periods
ranging from six to eighteen months? Surely, if 16 to 18
grams of nitrogen are a daily requisite for the healthy adult,
there should have been some sign of nitrogen starvation during
these long periods of low proteid diet, but the sharpest
scrutiny failed to find it. On the contrary, there were not
wanting signs of improved conditions of the body which
could not well be associated with anything but the changes
in diet.</p>

<p>Let us briefly consider the main facts. The writer, of 57
kilos body-weight, showed for nearly nine consecutive months
an average daily metabolism of 5.7 grams of nitrogen. During
the last two months the daily metabolism averaged 5.4
grams of nitrogen. As body-weight and nitrogen equilibrium
were both maintained under these conditions, it is certainly
fair to assume that the physiological needs of the body were
fully met. These figures imply a metabolism, in the first
instance, of 0.1 gram of nitrogen per kilo of body-weight,
while the lower figure shows a metabolism of 0.094 gram
of nitrogen per kilo of body-weight. We may call this
latter amount the minimal nitrogen requirement for this particular
individual, under which health, strength, and vigor
can be fully maintained. This lower nitrogen figure shows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
that the needs of this particular individual for proteid
material are met by the metabolism of 33.75 grams of proteid
per day. Hence, one-third the usually accepted standard
of proteid is quite sufficient for the wants of this particular
person, and this too with a quantity of non-nitrogenous food
far below the daily amount called for by ordinary physiological
rules. A fuel value of 2000 calories per day was fully
adequate to meet the ordinary wants of the body.</p>

<p>Dr. Mendel, with a body-weight of 70 kilos, showed for
seven consecutive months an average daily metabolism of
6.53 grams of nitrogen, likewise with maintenance of health,
strength, body equilibrium, and nitrogenous equilibrium.
This figure implies a nitrogen metabolism of 0.093 gram
per kilo of body-weight and shows that the wants of the
body—in his case—can be fully met by a metabolism of
40.8 grams of proteid matter daily, and this likewise without
increasing the amount of non-nitrogenous food ingested. Indeed,
a total fuel value of 2500 calories per day was quite
sufficient for all the needs of his body under the existing
conditions.</p>

<p>Dr. Underhill, with a body-weight of 65 kilos, showed for
six consecutive months a proteid metabolism equal to 7.81
grams of nitrogen per day, while for the last two months the
daily average excretion of nitrogen was only 6.68 grams.
These figures mean respectively a nitrogen metabolism of
0.120 and 0.102 gram of nitrogen per kilo of body-weight.
Here, too, as in the preceding cases, this lowered rate of
proteid metabolism was maintained without increasing the
total fuel value of the food and with a continuance of health
and strength.</p>

<p>Messrs. Dean and Beers, with body-weights of 64 and 61.5
kilos respectively, likewise kept up their health and strength
for a long period of time with a nitrogen metabolism averaging
8.99 and 8.58 grams of nitrogen per day, <i>i. e.</i>, with a
metabolism of 0.140 and 0.139 gram of nitrogen per kilo of
body-weight respectively, and this with a total fuel value in
their daily food averaging not more than 2500 calories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>With this general concurrence of results, we are certainly
warranted in the assertion that the professional man can safely
practise a physiological economy in the use of proteid food
equal to a saving of one-half to two-thirds the amount called
for by existing dietary standards, and this without increasing
the amount of non-nitrogenous food consumed. Indeed, the
latter class of foods can likewise be diminished in amount
without detriment to health or strength, where there is no
call for great physical exertion. Lastly, the so-called minimal
proteid requirement of the healthy man—which for this
group of individuals we may place at the low level of 0.093 to
0.130 gram of nitrogen per kilo of body-weight—represents
the real physiological needs of the system for nitrogen, and in
so far as our present data show, anything beyond this quantity
may be considered as an excess over and above what is required
for the actual physiological necessities of the body.
Naturally, however, there may be nothing detrimental in a
slight excess of proteid beyond the daily needs. That is
a subject, however, to be discussed later in connection with
other results.</p>

<p>In view of the close agreement in the amount of nitrogen
metabolized by these different individuals per kilo of body-weight,
emphasis should be laid upon the fact that the results
recorded were all obtained with perfect freedom of choice
in the matter of diet, without prescription of any kind, so that
the close concurrence in the final figures tends to strengthen
the value of the data as pointing to a certain minimal requirement
easily attainable, and fully adequate for meeting the
needs of the body.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="II_EXPERIMENTS_WITH_VOLUNTEERS">II. EXPERIMENTS WITH VOLUNTEERS FROM THE
HOSPITAL CORPS OF THE UNITED STATES
ARMY.</h2>

</div>

<p>The original Detachment from the Hospital Corps of the
United States Army detailed to serve in this series of experiments
arrived in New Haven September 28, 1903, under the
command of Dr. Wallace DeWitt, 1st Lieutenant and assistant
Surgeon of the United States Army. The detail was
composed of twenty men, of whom fourteen were privates,
volunteers for the experiment, the remainder being made up
of non-commissioned officers, cook, cook’s helper, etc. The
detachment was located in a convenient house on Vanderbilt
Square belonging to the Sheffield Scientific School, and there
they lived during their six months’ stay in New Haven under
military discipline, and subject to the constant surveillance of
the commanding officer and the non-commissioned officers.</p>

<p>In selecting the men for the experiment particular attention
was paid to securing as great a variety of types as possible,
representing different nationalities, temperaments, etc.
Naturally, among such a group of enlisted men brought together
for the purpose in view many were found unsuited for
various reasons, and were quickly exchanged for others better
adapted for the successful carrying out of the experiment.
Several quickly deserted, apparently not relishing the restrictions
under which they were compelled to live. The
restriction which constituted the greatest hardship in the eyes
of several of the men was the regularity of life insisted upon,
and the consequent restraint placed upon their movements in
the city when relieved from duty. The following Statement
from Dr. DeWitt will explain the causes of removal of the
men who dropped out of the experiment during the natural
sifting process of the first few weeks and later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Hospital Corps Detachment U. S. Army,<br>
332 Temple St., New Haven, Conn.,<br>
March 17, 1904.</span></p>

<p class="hanging">Professor <span class="smcap">Russell H. Chittenden</span>,<br>
<i>Director Sheffield Scientific School</i>,<br>
<span class="smcap">New Haven, Conn.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—In compliance with your verbal request concerning men
of this detachment lost by transfer and desertion and the reasons
therefor, I have the honor to inform you that the following men
were lost by transfer, at my request, for the reasons set after their
respective names:</p>

<p class="hanging">Private <span class="smcap">Edward Mcdermott</span> (October 17, 1903). Mentally
and morally unsuited.</p>

<p class="hanging">Private <span class="smcap">Paul Forkel</span> (October 18, 1903). Physically unsuited.</p>

<p class="hanging">Private <span class="smcap">David Acker</span> (October 24, 1903). Physically unsuited
by reason of Acute Pulmonary Tuberculosis Bilateral.</p>

<p class="hanging">Private <span class="smcap">William C. Witzig</span> (November 17, 1903). Physically
unsuited by reason of Cardiac Irritability.</p>

<p class="hanging">Private <span class="smcap">Philip S. Myer</span> (December 11, 1903). Physically unsuited
by reason of very high grade of Myopia both eyes.</p>

<p class="hanging">Private first class <span class="smcap">Charles P. Davis</span> (January 14, 1904).
Physically unsuited by reason of Acute Melancholia.</p>

<p class="hanging">Private <span class="smcap">Barnard Bates</span> (February 12, 1904). Morally and
mentally unsuited by reason of Drunkenness.</p>

<p>In all these men, except Private <span class="smcap">Davis</span>, the condition for which
they were transferred was present when they reported for duty
with the detachment.</p>

<p>In the case of Private <span class="smcap">Davis</span>, his condition of acute melancholia
in my opinion was incident to the experiment,—due to the necessary
restrictions of liberty and food, assisted by a natural gloomy
disposition.</p>

<p>The following men were lost by desertion:</p>

<p class="hanging">Private first class <span class="smcap">Samuel R. Curtis</span> (November 3, 1903).</p>

<p class="hanging">Private first class <span class="smcap">William Smith</span> (November 5, 1903).</p>

<p class="hanging">Private <span class="smcap">Simon Prins</span> (January 23, 1904).</p>

<p class="hanging">Private <span class="smcap">Edwin A. Rinard</span> (February 3, 1904).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>Of these men Private first class Smith and Private Prins were
on duty in the kitchen and were at no time subject to restriction
of diet and liberty. Private first class Curtis deserted before the
experiment was well under way and can not be attributed to any
cause arising out of the investigation. Private Rinard’s desertion
was in my opinion due to the restrictions of diet and liberty incident
to the experiment. I would say, however, that this man
was a worthless character and was discharged “without honor”
from the army during a previous enlistment.</p>

<p class="center">Very respectfully,</p>

<p class="right">(Signed) <span class="smcap">Wallace Dewitt</span>,<br>
<i>1st Lieut. and Asst. Surgeon U. S. Army,<br>
Commdg. Detachment.</i></p>

</div>

<p>As supplementing Dr. DeWitt’s statement it may be mentioned
that Rinard reported for the experiment at New Haven
on December 11, 1903, and remained here until February
2, 1904. On December 11 he weighed 59.8 kilos, while on
February 2, the last day he was here, his body-weight was
60 kilos. Evidently, any restriction of diet he may have
suffered had not made any great impression upon his bodily
condition.</p>

<p id="contents16">There were thirteen men of the detachment who really
took part in the experiment, and of these all but four were in
the original detail. Of these four, two joined in October and
two early in November. Of these thirteen, all but two continued
to the close of the experiment, April 4, 1904.</p>

<p>The following statement gives the name, age, birthplace,
occupation, length of service (U. S. Army), etc. of the
thirteen men.</p>

<p>It will be noted that the men range in age from twenty-one
years six months to forty-three years, and that representatives
of many countries are on the list.</p>

<p>Regarding the duties of the men, <i>i. e.</i>, their daily work, the
following statement from Dr. DeWitt will give all needed information
on this point. The character of the Gymnasium
work will be referred to later.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—In compliance with your verbal request I have the honor
to inform you that the duties of this detachment during the tour
of duty at this station have been as follows:—</p>

<p>At 6.45 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> the men arise and their body-weights are taken
immediately, after which they dress and assemble for reveille roll-call.</p>

<p>7.15. Breakfast. After this meal they are all engaged in various
duties about the quarters, such as inside and outside police, kitchen
police, assisting in measurement of urine and fæces and transportation
of the same to the laboratory; cleansing of fæces cans
and urine bottles, etc. They are occupied with these various
duties until about 9 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span></p>

<p>9 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> Detachment proceeds to Gymnasium under charge of a
non-commissioned officer, and by him reported to the gymnastic
instructor.</p>

<p>11 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> Detachment returns from Gymnasium.</p>

<p>12 <span class="allsmcap">M.</span> Dinner.</p>

<p>1 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> Drill, weather permitting, otherwise a walk in charge
of a non-commissioned officer, or indoor instruction relative to the
duties of a soldier.</p>

<p>2 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> Relief from drill; walk, or instruction.</p>

<p>2.30 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> Instruction by a non-commissioned officer in their
duties as nurses, etc.</p>

<p>3.30 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> Relief from instruction.</p>

<p>5 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> Supper.</p>

<p>5.30 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> Retreat roll-call.</p>

<p>10 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> All men in bed.</p>

<p>This routine is the same for every day in the week except Saturday
and Sunday. On Saturday drill and instruction in the afternoon
are omitted, and on Sundays the men are also free from gymnasium
work.</p>

<p>In addition to the duties mentioned above, a special detail of
two men is made every morning to assist in the weighing and serving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
of the food, and from time to time details are sent to the laboratory
and reported to Dr. Mendel for such work connected with
the investigation as he might assign them.</p>

<p class="center">Very respectfully,</p>

</div>

<p>Here we have a group of men, thirteen in number, quite
different in type from the preceding group; men accustomed
to living a vigorous life under varying conditions, and
who naturally had great liking for the pleasures of eating.
Further, they were men who had no personal interest whatever
in the experiment or in the principles involved. To be
sure, they had volunteered for the work, and the objects of
the experiment had been fully explained to them. Like good
soldiers they no doubt desired to obey orders, and they doubtless
preferred to see the experiment a success rather than a
failure, but they had not that interest that would lead them
to undergo any great personal discomfort. This point should
be kept in mind, since it has a distinct bearing upon the possibility
of establishing physiological economy of diet in persons
who would not willingly incommode themselves or suffer
personal inconvenience.</p>

<p>The experiment commenced on October 4, 1903, and for
a period of six months every detail bearing upon the nutrition
and condition of the men under the gradually changed conditions
was carefully observed. Every precaution to preserve
the health and good spirits of the men was taken. Pure distilled
water was sent to the quarters each morning, magazines
and other periodicals were supplied through the courtesy of
friends, occasional visits to the theatre were indulged in; in
fact all that could be done to counterbalance any possible
depressing influence from the partial restraints of the experiment
was arranged for.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp95" id="illus01" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus01.jpg" alt="">
  <p class="caption"><i>Showing a group of the soldiers at work in the gymnasium.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Regarding the details of the work; the twenty-four hours’
urine was collected by each man, also the fæces for each day,
and these were subjected to chemical analysis with a view to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
following out the various changes in the amount and character
of the proteid metabolism going on in the body as
measured by the output of total nitrogen, uric acid, and phosphoric
acid in the urine, and by the amount of nitrogen in
the fæces with reference to the degree of digestion and utilization
of the proteid foods ingested.</p>

<p>During the first two weeks the ordinary army rations were
given to the men; later a gradual change was made, accompanied
by a reduction in the amount of proteid food, with
some reduction likewise in the total fuel value of the food.
All the food placed before each man was carefully weighed,
and at the close of every meal any uneaten food was weighed
and the amount subtracted from the initial weights. During
the balance periods, when the income and output of nitrogen
were carefully compared, the food materials were weighed
with greater care and large samples of each article were
taken for analysis, to determine the exact content of nitrogen.
Every figure for nitrogen shown in the tables was
verified by at least a duplicate chemical analysis so as to
avoid any possibility of error.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to give here any detailed description of
the changes made in the character of the diet, since on <a href="#Page_288">pages
288 to 326</a> may be found the daily dietary from October 2,
1903, to April 4, 1904,—each meal of the day,—showing
the amount and character of the food given the men during
the six months period. It should be stated, however, that at
no time were the men placed on a cereal diet or on a truly
vegetable diet. The object in view was simply to study the
possibilities of a general physiological economy in diet, with
special reference to the minimal proteid requirement of the
healthy man. To be sure, in doing this meats, owing to their
high content of proteid, were very much reduced in amount
and on many days no meat at all was given, but as the dietary
is looked through it will be seen that the main change was
from a heavy meat diet (rich in proteid) to a lighter diet,
comparatively poor in proteid, with an increasing predominance
of vegetable and cereal foods. Condiments are also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
noticeable in the diet, together with the ordinary accessories,
coffee and tea. Variety was also considered as a necessary
factor, not to be overlooked, as contributing largely to the
maintenance of a proper physiological condition.</p>

<p>From a study of the tables which follow, showing the
chemical composition of the daily urine, it will be seen that
during the first sixteen days, viz., from October 4 until October
20 or 21, when the men were on the ordinary army ration
with opportunity to eat an abundance of meat, the daily
urine frequently contained 16 to 17 grams of nitrogen, showing
a metabolism of over 100 grams of proteid on such
days. Sliney, indeed, averaged for four days an output of
18.19 grams of nitrogen, while Coffman, Henderson, and
Zooman showed an average daily excretion of about 15 grams
of nitrogen each for the sixteen days from October 4.</p>

<p>Any elaborate discussion of the individual results, tabulated
in the foregoing tables, seems hardly necessary. To any one
interested in the details of the work, a study of the tables
themselves will give the necessary information. It may be
well, however, to emphasize at once a few of the fundamental
points most striking in character which bear upon the main
problem. Take, for instance, the case of Oakman, where the
data are recorded for every day from October 4, 1903, to
April 4, 1904. The degree of proteid metabolism, as indicated
by the excretion of nitrogen through the kidneys, is
here shown for each day of the six months. Up to November
3, practically for a month, there was not observable any
very noticeable change in the rate of proteid metabolism,
but commencing with November 4, the nitrogen excretion
dropped very rapidly, and as one glances through the daily
records for month after month, it is seen that the daily nitrogen
output through the kidneys fell to 6 to 8 grams per day,
with a daily average excretion of 7.42 grams of nitrogen, as
figured from October 21 to April 4.</p>

<p>Further, it will be noted that while the body-weight gradually
declined during the first three months, falling from 66.7
kilos down to 62.3 kilos on January 18, from that date on
to the close of the experiment the body-weight was practically
constant. Here, then, we see, under the use of a prescribed
diet quite sufficient in amount to satisfy the cravings of the
appetite, a lowering of proteid metabolism equal to that obtained
by the individuals of the preceding group. Again, if
the body-weight of Oakman is placed at 64 kilos, as representing
the average between the initial body-weight and the
weight during the last three months, it will be found that
the output of metabolized nitrogen per kilo of body-weight
amounted to 0.116 gram; not widely different from similar
data obtained with men of the preceding group.</p>

  <p class="caption">FRITZ</p>
  <p class="caption"><i>Photograph taken at the close of the experiment.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Moreover, these results obtained with Oakman are practically
duplicated by every other member of this group of soldiers
detailed from the United States Army. No exception
whatever is to be seen, but every man shows the same lowered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
proteid metabolism, with practical maintenance of body-weight,
with complete satisfying of the appetite, and without
loss of health, strength, or vigor, as will be enlarged upon
later.</p>

<p>While in the case of Oakman, the nitrogen excreted was
determined by an analysis made each day, in the case of the
other men of this group the data are given mainly for weekly
periods; the results being expressed, however, in the average
daily amount for each seven days’ period. By comparing the
figures for the daily excretion of nitrogen with the daily
dietary, it is easy to trace out the influence of the changes
in diet on the extent of nitrogen metabolism.</p>

<p>In considering the changes in the rate of proteid metabolism
shown by all the members of this group, it will suffice
for present purposes to deal mainly with the average results.</p>

<p>Compare now the average daily output of nitrogen through
the urine from November 1 until April 4—a period of five
months—of each of these men.</p>

<p>The figures given show an astonishingly low proteid metabolism
for the five months’ period; 7.5 grams of nitrogen in the
day’s urine correspond to 46.8 grams of proteid metabolized,
while 8.5 grams of nitrogen mean the metabolism of 53.1<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
grams of proteid. In other words, all of these men during a
period of five months practically averaged a daily output of
nitrogen through the kidneys corresponding to the metabolism
of less than one-half the 105 grams of absorbable proteid
called for by the so-called standard diets. Further, close scrutiny
of the results in the individual tables shows that during
many weeks much lower results were obtained than is indicated
by the general averages.</p>

<p>Just here emphasis should be laid upon one fact, doubtless
of primary importance in any modification of the rate or extent
of metabolism in any individual, viz., that in this experiment
the daily diet was prescribed, thereby taking from the
individual freedom of choice in the selection of food. The
writer has no question in his own mind that an intelligent
choice of food, coupled with the satisfying of a natural or acquired
appetite in moderation, will lead to better results than
any system of prescription as to what shall be eaten each day
and in what quantity. Still, this is the method necessarily
made use of in the present experiment, the writer having
prescribed the character and amount of each meal throughout
the entire six months’ period, with due regard, of course, to
the expressed likes and dislikes of the men.</p>

<p>One feature in the diet compelled by the circumstances of
the case also needs to be referred to, namely, the necessity of
keeping the men thoroughly satisfied, so that there should be
no feeling of hunger, no craving for food. With a person interested
in the experiment and desirous of ascertaining the
effect of a low nitrogen intake, there would naturally be a
willingness to endure, if necessary, for a time some personal
discomfort; but with this detail of the United States Army it
could not be expected that the men would remain satisfied if
they were compelled to undergo the pangs of hunger even for
a day or two. Consequently, it was necessary in prescribing
the daily diet to see that the quantity of the food was such
as to completely satisfy the appetite. This necessitated the
use of considerable bulky food of low fuel, and low nitrogen,
value. In this way only was it feasible to reduce the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
nitrogen intake, as well as the fuel value of the food, to
the desired level. Practically during the entire six months’
period, with the possible exception of a few days, the men
were given sufficient food to completely satisfy their appetites.
Throughout the entire period of the experiment, the
men all manifested a keen appetite and utilized their food to
good advantage, with establishment of the nitrogen metabolism
indicated by the foregoing results.</p>

<p id="contents20">Still confining our attention to the average results regarding
nitrogen excretion, we may ask the question, what was the
excretion of metabolized nitrogen per kilo of body-weight in
the different individuals? This is easily calculated and the
data are shown in the following table, in which the figures
standing for body-weight are either the data for the month of
April, 1904, or else the average between the October and April
weights, as in those cases where the body-weight fell off during
the experiment.</p>

<p>Scrutiny of these results shows that the daily excretion of
metabolized nitrogen ranged in this period of five months from
0.106 gram per kilo of body-weight up to 0.150 gram per kilo
of body-weight. Since these men were on essentially the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
same diet, it is obvious that there were some peculiarities,
or personal idiosyncrasies, that tended to modify the exact
extent of proteid metabolism, and in some cases at least constituted
a more potent factor than body-weight in determining
the rate of metabolism. This fact is clearly emphasized
in the case of Morris, who, with a body-weight of 59 kilos,
showed a proteid metabolism equivalent to only 7.03 grams
of nitrogen per day, and Coffman, who, with a body-weight
of 58 kilos, showed under the same conditions an average
excretion of 8.17 grams of nitrogen per day.</p>

<p id="contents21">What was the effect of this lowered proteid metabolism upon
the bodily condition, especially body-weight? To answer this
question the weights of the men are given in the following
table, the one column of figures showing the body-weight
at the commencement of the experiment, the other column
showing the weight at the close of the experiment.</p>

<p>Comparison of these figures shows that six of the men were
practically of the same body-weight at the close of the experiment
as at the beginning. Of the others, Oakman, Fritz, Cohn,
and Bates lost somewhat. Bates, however, was quite stout, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
the work in the gymnasium as well as the change of diet
tended to reduce his weight. In fact, with the possible exception
of Oakman, the slight loss of weight these latter men
underwent was a distinct gain to their bodily condition. The
most significant feature, however, is to be found on scrutiny
of the tables of results for each man, where is seen the body-weight
for each day of the six months. Here it will be noticed
that, as the experiment progressed, there was, as a rule,
a tendency for the body-weight to increase; this was followed
by a decline, after which the weight remained practically stationary.
This is well illustrated in Oakman’s case. Starting
with a body-weight of 66.7 kilos on October 4, he reached 67.6
kilos on November 29, then declining in weight to 62.3 on
January 18, after which he remained practically stationary,
or varied only within narrow limits.</p>

<p>Finally, it should be said that the low proteid metabolism
on which these men were apparently maintaining body-weight
was not associated with any increase of non-nitrogenous food.
At no time did the fuel value of the daily food reach 3000
calories; in fact, about January 12 the average fuel value of
the food was only a little over 2000 calories per day.</p>

<h3 id="contents22"><span class="smcap">First Nitrogen Balance.</span></h3>

<p>Early in January, the body-weight of the men having become
practically stationary and the proteid metabolism, as
measured by the output of metabolized nitrogen, having been
reduced to a low level, an attempt was made to see if the
men were truly in a condition of nitrogenous equilibrium.
A six-day period was used, during which all the food for each
meal was carefully analyzed, the nitrogen in every sample of
food being determined in duplicate by the Kjeldahl-Gunning
process. The fæces of the period were separated by lampblack,
given at appropriate times in gelatin capsules, and all
necessary precautions observed to insure an accurate nitrogen
balance. The accompanying tables of results give all the
necessary data.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>The average nitrogen intake per day was 8.23 grams, and the
average fuel value of the food per day was 2078 calories.
These are the figures for Oakman. With some of the other
men there were slight variations from these figures, as shown
in the tables—owing to slight variations in diet. Without
exception, all the men showed a minus balance, indicating
that on this diet the body was losing nitrogen. In other words,
the diet as a whole was insufficient for the needs of the body
in every case. Whether this was due to lack of sufficient proteid
or to an insufficient amount of fat and carbohydrate, <i>i. e.</i>,
a too low fuel value, cannot be said definitely, but there is
every reason to believe that the amount of non-nitrogenous
food was insufficient to furnish the requisite fuel value, and
consequently body proteid was drawn upon to supply the
deficiency. The loss of nitrogen to the body per day varied
as a rule from 0.5 to 2.0 grams. In one case only, viz.,
Broyles, was there a close approach to a balance. In his case
there was a minus balance of only 0.12 gram of nitrogen
per day.</p>

<p>The average daily output of nitrogen through the urine for
this six-days period (Oakman’s case) was 7.52 grams.</p>

<h3 id="contents23"><span class="smcap">Second Nitrogen Balance.</span></h3>

<p>Commencing February 29, a second nitrogen balance was
attempted with very different results. This balance period
extended through seven days and was characterized by an
average daily intake of 9.50 grams of nitrogen, an increase of
1.3 grams of nitrogen per day over the preceding period, together
with an average fuel value of the food equal to 2500
calories per day.</p>

<p>The daily diet with its content of nitrogen, etc., is detailed
under Oakman. Any variations (only slight ones) from this
diet are indicated on the individual balance-sheets, corrections
being made in the nitrogen intake.</p>

<p>In all of the men, with one exception, a distinct plus balance
is seen, showing that under the conditions of this experiment
the men were all storing up nitrogen. The plus balance
per day varied from 0.132 gram to 1.231 grams of nitrogen.</p>

<p>The average daily output of nitrogen through the urine for
this seven days’ period (Oakman’s case) was 7.24 grams, being
0.28 gram less per day than in the preceding period. Sliney,
the one man who failed to show a positive balance, was apparently
losing nitrogen at the rate of 0.48 gram per day
during this period.</p>

<p>All of the individual data are shown in the accompanying
tables of results:</p>

<h3 id="contents24"><span class="smcap">Third Nitrogen Balance</span>.</h3>

<p>The last of March, a third nitrogen balance was tried on a
slightly lowered nitrogen intake and with a slight increase in
the fuel value of the daily food. In this period of five days,
March 28 to April 1, the nitrogen taken in per day averaged
8.62 grams, or nearly one gram per day less than in
the preceding period. The fuel value of the food averaged
2840 calories per day, or about 300 calories more than in the
preceding period.</p>

<p>The daily diet, with its content of nitrogen, etc., is detailed
for each day under Oakman. Any deviation from this diet in
the cases of the other men is indicated on the accompanying
balance-sheets.</p>

<p>The results obtained in this balance period indicate that
the lowest level had been practically reached, at least under
the conditions of body-weight, food, and work prevailing.
Cohn, Fritz, and Broyles showed a distinct positive balance.
Steltz and Loewenthal were practically in equilibrium, the
deviation being within the limits of error. The remaining
six men showed a minus balance, although in no case was it
very marked.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note in this connection that the average
daily output of nitrogen through the urine for this five days’
period (Oakman’s case) amounted to 7.04 grams, being 0.2
gram less per day than in the preceding period. This figure
for nitrogen in the urine means the metabolism daily of 44
grams of proteid.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, the rate of proteid metabolism for these men
could have been lowered considerably beyond the present
level by increasing largely the intake of carbohydrates and
fats, but it has been the intent throughout all of these experiments
to learn the minimal proteid requirement under conditions
precluding the use of any excess of non-nitrogenous
foods; also, to study the effect of a general physiological
economy in nutrition, with a view to ascertaining the real
necessities of the body for both proteid and non-proteid foods<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
with maintenance of bodily strength and vigor. Hence, we
may again emphasize the fact that the low proteid metabolism
maintained by all these men throughout the period of the
experiment, with establishment of nitrogenous equilibrium on
a consumption of proteid or albuminous food averaging one-half
the amount ordinarily specified as the daily requirement
of the healthy man, has been accomplished with even less total
food—fats and carbohydrates—than the ordinary standards
call for, <i>i. e.</i>, considerably less than 3000 calories per day in
fuel value.</p>

<h3 id="contents25"><span class="smcap">Summary Regarding Nitrogen Requirement.</span></h3>

<p>These results obtained with this body of United States
soldiers, living on a prescribed diet and exposed to the stress
and strain of military discipline with its attendant duties, together
with the gymnastic work and training required each
day, confirm in every detail the conclusions arrived at with
the preceding group of professional workers. Once accustomed
to a more sparing proteid diet, less rich in nitrogen,
each one of these subjects had no difficulty in maintaining
body-weight on the simpler and lighter food provided. No
great difficulty was experienced in establishing a condition of
nitrogenous equilibrium with this lowered intake of proteid
food, neither was it necessary to increase the amounts of non-nitrogenous
foods (fats and carbohydrates) to accomplish
this end. The bodies of these men were quite able to adjust
themselves to a lowered proteid metabolism, and physiologically
speaking, one might well conjecture whether we have
not in this condition a nearer approach to the normal and
ideal state of the body than when the latter is struggling
daily with 118 grams of proteid food, reinforced by fats and
carbohydrates correspondingly increased in amount. However
this may be, the members of the soldier detail were able
to live for five consecutive months with a proteid metabolism
corresponding to 7 to 8 grams of nitrogen per day, with maintenance
of body-weight and without discomfort or loss of
bodily vigor.</p>

<p>It was easy in most instances to prove the establishment of
nitrogen equilibrium with a daily intake of 8.5 to 9.5 grams of
nitrogen, and with a total fuel value of the daily food equal
to 2500 to 2800 calories. In other words, a metabolism of less
than 50 grams of proteid per day was quite sufficient for the
needs of the body, and a fuel value of 2500 to 2600 calories
was ample to meet the requirements of the men under the
then existing conditions of bodily and mental activity. Are
we not justified, therefore, in again asking the question, why
should we hold and teach the doctrine that the healthy adult<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
needs to metabolize 105 grams of proteid food daily? As Voit
has well said, the smallest amount of food that will serve to
maintain physiological equilibrium and keep up health and
strength is the ideal diet. The eleven subjects of this Hospital
detachment, who remained throughout the experiment, were
apparently able to maintain physiological equilibrium and preserve
their health and strength under the conditions of diet as
described, thereby demonstrating the possibilities of a physiological
economy corresponding to a saving of full fifty per
cent or more in proteid food; a saving of possibly great physiological
import, to say nothing of the possible economic and
sociological importance of the saving. Further, we may add
that the minimal proteid requirement as evidenced by the results
of these experiments is more than fifty per cent lower
than the figures quoted by most physiologists as necessary for
the maintenance of life and strength; and we are certainly
justified in the additional statement that if the figures obtained
in these experiments truly represent the <i>minimal</i> proteid
requirement of the men under observation, then this
minimal requirement is quite sufficient to meet the physiological
needs of the body for an indefinite period.</p>

<h3 id="contents26"><span class="smcap">Physical Condition of the Men.</span></h3>

<p>Recalling the fact that this condition of lowered proteid
metabolism was maintained for a period of five months, we
may next consider the effect of this changed nutritive condition
upon the health and strength of the men. The question
of body-weight we have already considered. More pertinent
is the question, to how great an extent was the strength and
bodily vigor of the men modified by the diminished amount
of proteid food? The answer to this question is found in the
subjoined report from Dr. William G. Anderson, Director of
the Yale University Gymnasium.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Yale University Gymnasium,<br>
New Haven, Conn.</span>, April 6, 1904.</p>

<p class="hanging">To Professor <span class="smcap">Russell H. Chittenden</span>,<br>
<i>Director of the Sheffield Scientific School, Yale University</i>,<br>
<span class="smcap">New Haven, Conn.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,—I hand you herewith a report of the physical
training of the squad of soldiers sent by you to the Yale
Gymnasium.</p>

<p>These men have taken one hour’s exercise daily for six months,
Sundays excepted,—October 1, 1903, to April 1, 1904.</p>

<p>Before beginning the bodily development of the men we
measured each one and took what are known as the American
Collegiate Strength Tests. These measurements and tests have
been taken twice each month. For details as to measurements
and methods of testing the strength of the body, see the “Notes”
attached to this report.</p>

<p>The members of the squad were called to the floor each morning
as soon after nine-thirty as they could don the required suit. For
twenty minutes they were put through a series of setting up exercises
and body-building movements; then followed exercises on the
apparatus, such as bars, rings, ladders, etc. This was followed by
a jump or game.</p>

<p>The exercises were progressive as to duration, force, extent, and
number of movements. At the end of the six months the men were
being put through gymnastics that were exacting and fatiguing.
As the progression was carefully made, the men did not suffer
from soreness to any marked degree. By way of comparison it
may be said, the gymnastic training given the soldiers was much
more severe than is given to the Freshmen of Yale in their required
physical training. Perhaps the Varsity Crew are “put through”
as rigid gymnastic training as any of the athletes in college, so we
copied the exercises taken by oarsmen in order to “try out” the
soldiers. This work was easily taken by all the “Dieters,”—no
complaint, so far as I know, having been entered.</p>

<p>The improvement in accuracy and grace of movement has been
noticeable, while there has been a gain in skill as well.</p>

<p>I do not consider these men, as a body, well put up. They did
not rank favorably with applicants for policeman or fireman and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
were noticeably timid in exercises that called for courage. In
the vault over a fence there was a very marked fear. This was
the poorest and least satisfactory test of all we made. At the end
of the six months the hesitancy to vault had entirely disappeared,
the event being looked upon by the men as a “cinch.”</p>

<p>The gain in self-reliance and courage has been as evident as the
increase in the figures of the strength test. I consider this a valuable
acquisition as it stands for a good body condition. Among
athletes, especially gymnasts, a weakened or tired body is made
known by fear or uncertainty. Our students, as well as professional
athletes, admit this.</p>

<p>I attribute the timidity of the soldiers in these seemingly simple
tests to their general physical condition at the outset, and the increase
in self-reliance to the better condition of their bodies at the
end of the six months’ training. The story told by the measurements
is both interesting and significant, but of less importance
than the ability to improve under training, which ability cannot
be measured with a tape or weighed with scales.</p>

<p>In the majority of cases there was a loss in body-weight, but this
we look for, as the larger number of soldiers were fairly well supplied
with adipose tissue. Both Sliney and Oakman are exceptions,
these men being “fine” at the outset. I mean thin and muscular
with little fat. The latter, Oakman, is an old man judged from
the physical activity standpoint, and lost noticeably during the
tests and exercise. I refer to weight and girth measurements only.
He made a very large gain in his strength tests and was among
the leading men in all that called for courage and self-control.
Sliney, nervous, irritable, and aggressive, balanced his losses with
his gains in the tape and scale events, but made great improvement
in the use of the dynamometers. Fritz and Cohn were quite fat
and showed the expected loss in weight, but not in other respects.</p>

<p>For comparison I have quoted from Dr. J. W. Seaver’s anthropometric
charts and have selected the “Average Student Measurements”
(2390 men) as well as the mean measurements of 500
athletes and gymnasts. A glance at either set of figures will give
an idea of how the soldiers compare with men living on a regular
diet and surrounded with the very best environment.</p>

<p>The strength tests stand for mental states more than the tape
line and calipers, and are suggestive of improvement in body conditions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
for the reasons mentioned above. These records are far
above those made by Academic Freshmen in Yale, but it must be
added that the soldiers have taken more exercise than the
collegians.</p>

<p>The hearts and lungs of the men are in excellent condition,
while the soldiers as a body are in better shape physically, are
stronger and healthier than in October. The skin of the men is
clear and ruddy.</p>

<p>The figures for comparison in the Strength Test Table are from
the records sent me by Dr. Geo. Meylan, the Director of the
Columbia University Gymnasium. I understand that others than
college men are represented in his data. In the figures given in
my own tables I have omitted the small fractions in the main
body of the tables, but have recorded them in the totals.</p>

<p>The greater portion of the training of the soldiers has been
under the personal supervision of Wm. H. Callahan, M. D., the
Medical Assistant at the Gymnasium, to whom I am indebted for
help and suggestions. Mr. Wm. Chase, Mr. Anton Muller, Mr. John
Stapleton, and Mr. H. R. Gladwin, Assistant Instructors in the
Gymnasium, have led the drills and have looked after the actual
muscular training of the men. I gladly acknowledge the co-operation
of these gentlemen in the physical development of the squad.</p>

<p>A brief summary of my conclusions:—</p>

<p>The men were not above the average standard, physically, when
they began their work, this standard being set by applicants for
firemen and policemen, not by college students. At the end of
their training they were much above the same standard, while
their strength tests were far greater than the averages made
by college men. They showed less improvement in increase in
size than University men do under like gymnastic treatment, but
the gain in self-confidence and in body-fibre was very evident.
The gain in accuracy and skill was marked. The men showed
interest in their work throughout the six months. At the end of
the period of training the soldiers were in excellent condition in
spite of the fact that in some cases there was a slight loss of body-weight.
This loss is not to be attributed necessarily to the diet,
because most men who exercise lose slightly if there is an excess
of adipose tissue.</p>

<p>Dr. Anderson furnishes the following “Notes” descriptive
of the methods by which the strength tests were made:</p>

<p>“<i>Strength of Back.</i> The subject, standing upon the iron
foot-rest with the dynamometer so arranged that when grasping
the handles with both hands his body will be inclined forward
at an angle of 60 degrees, should take a full breath and,
without bending the knees, give one hard lift, mostly with
the back.</p>

<p>“<i>Strength of Legs.</i> The subject while standing on the foot-rest
with body and head erect, and chest thrown forward,
should sink down, by bending the knees, until the handle
grasped rests against the thighs, then taking a full breath, he
should lift hard principally with the legs, using the hands to
hold the handle in place.</p>

<p>“<i>Strength of Chest.</i> The subject with his elbows extended
at the sides until the forearms are on the same horizontal
plane and holding the dynamometer so that the dial will face
outward and the indicator point upward, should take a full
breath and push vigorously against the handles, allowing the
back of the instrument to press on the chest.</p>

<p>“<i>Strength of Upper Arms, Triceps.</i> The subject, while holding
the position of rest upon the parallel bars, supporting his
weight with arms straight, should let the body down until
the chin is level with the bars, and then push it up again
until the arms are fully extended. Note the number of times
that he can lift himself in this manner.</p>

<p>“<i>Strength of Upper Arms, Biceps.</i> The subject should
grasp a horizontal bar or pair of rings and hang with the
feet clear from the floor while the arms are extended. Note
the number of times that he can haul his body up until his
chin touches the bar or ring.</p>

<p>“<i>Strength of Forearms.</i> The subject, while holding the dynamometer
so that the dial is turned inward, should squeeze the
spring as hard as possible, first with the right hand then with
the left. The strength of the muscles between the shoulders
may be tested with the same instrument. The subject, while
holding the dynamometer on a level with the chest, should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
grasp it with handles and pull both arms from the centre
outward.</p>

<p>“<i>The total strength</i> is ascertained by multiplying the weight
by the number of times it has been raised (push up and pull
up), to this product we add the strength of hands, legs, back,
and chest. The result is the total strength of the man. In
some cases the product obtained by multiplying the weight
by push up and pull up is divided by ten to reduce the size
of the figures. We have not done so here.</p>

<p>“The run, vault, and ladder tests are not figured in. The
lung capacity is also omitted from the final figures.”</p>

<p class="tb">The following tables furnished by Dr. Anderson and Dr.
Callahan give (1) the <i>measurements</i> of the eleven men who
completed the experiment, taken on October 12, 1903, and
April 2, 1904. For comparison are also given measurements
of Yale College students, athletes, etc. (2) <i>Strength</i> or dynamometer
tests, <i>i. e.</i>, the first test taken in October and the final
test taken in April, 1904, together with Columbia University
strength tests for comparison. (3) A series of eleven tables
giving for each man the individual strength tests, two or
three each month, taken during the stay of the detachment
in New Haven. Study of these individual results is quite
interesting, since it shows very strikingly the gradual gain in
strength of the men, and at the same time illustrates how
temporary conditions, bodily or mental, may influence a
record of this character, more noticeable in some individuals
than in others. Mental stimulus, as is well known, counts
for much in the manifestation of muscular power, but the
neuro-muscular mechanism depends for its highest efficiency
upon the nutritive condition of the tissues as much as does
the muscle tissue alone. In the obtaining of a strength test,
it is usually found that the best results are recorded when
there is competition among the men; <i>i. e.</i>, under the influence
of an outside stimulus.</p>

<p class="tb">The main things in Dr. Anderson’s report especially to be
emphasized are (1) the gain in self-reliance and courage of
the men under training, indicative as they are of the better
physical condition of their bodies, and (2) the marked increase<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
in their strength as indicated by the steady improvement
in the strength or dynamometer tests. Obviously, the
daily training to which the men were subjected in the Gymnasium
is not to be overlooked as one factor in bringing
about the gain in accuracy and skill, and indeed this factor
must count for something in explaining the general gain
in bodily strength, but increased skill alone will not account
for the great gain in muscular power.</p>

<p>The results of these systematic tests make it very evident
that the men were not being weakened by the lowered intake
of proteid food. On the contrary, their ability to do muscular
work was greatly increased; a fact which cannot well be connected
with anything other than the physiological economy
which was being practised. There must be enough food to
make good the daily waste of tissue, enough food to furnish
the energy of muscular contraction, but any surplus over and
above what is necessary to supply these needs is not only a
waste, but may prove an incubus, retarding the smooth working
of the machinery and detracting from the power of the
muscular mechanism to do its best work.</p>

<p id="contents29">The figures showing the total strength of the men in
October, 1903, on their ordinary diet, and on the second day
of April, 1904, when the experiment was nearing completion
are certainly very impressive.</p>

<p>Here we see gains in strength of 100 per cent in some
cases, while Coffman shows an improvement so marked as to
be almost marvellous. While there can be no question that
a certain amount of this gain is to be attributed to the practice
incidental to these months of work in the Gymnasium, it
is equally clear that a large part of the gain is due to the
improved physical condition of the men’s bodies, for which
the change in diet must be considered as responsible. In any
event, the change from the ordinary diet to a diet comparatively
poor in proteid has not resulted in any physical deterioration.
On the contrary, there is every indication of a
marked improvement in physical condition. In this connection
the following note from Dr. DeWitt, commanding the
detachment, is of interest:</p>

</div>

<p>Finally, attention may be called to the photographs of the
men, taken just prior to the close of the experiment, from
which may be gained some idea of their physical condition so
far as it can be judged by external appearance. Certainly,
there is no indication in these photographs of any lack of
bodily vigor. On the contrary, there is good muscular
development, without any undue amount of fat, and indeed
every indication of a good bodily condition, coupled with that
appearance of quickness and alertness that belongs to the well-developed
man, in a state of physiological balance. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
photographs scattered through this section of the book, showing
the soldiers at work in the gymnasium, likewise give
some idea of the lighter forms of exercise they followed each
day in the training of bodily movements.</p>

<p class="tb">What now is to be said regarding the nervous condition of
the men; <i>i. e.</i>, their ability to respond to stimulation or, in
other words, their mental quickness or reaction time? To
study this question, the soldiers were sent with regularity to
the Yale Psychological Laboratory, where their reaction time
was studied with great care. The results of this investigation
are contained in the following report made by Dr. Charles
H. Judd, in charge of the Yale Psychological Laboratory.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<h3 id="contents30">REPORT ON REACTION TIME.</h3>

<p>In order to test the quickness of the members of the Hospital
Corps Detachment, and to determine whether the changes in diet
affected in any way their ability to respond promptly to sensory
stimulation, each man was carried through a series of reaction
experiments at the Yale Psychological Laboratory. The
method of the experiments was that regularly employed in simple
reaction time experiments. The person whose reaction time is to
be measured is seated in a comfortable position with his finger pressing
on an electric key. He is told that he is to lift his finger from
the key as quickly as possible when he hears a given sound-signal.
The sounder which produces this signal and the electric key are
placed in a circuit with a standard time-measuring apparatus—the
Hipp Chronoscope. This chronoscope is arranged so that it
begins to record the instant the sound is given and stops the instant
the reactor lifts his finger. The dial of the chronoscope
shows in thousandths of a second (hereafter designated by the
technical term <i>sigmas</i>) the time that elapses between the sound to
which the reactor is to respond and the movement of response.
The chronoscope was tested at frequent intervals by means of a
standard pendulum and errors in the record are well under two
sigmas.</p>

<p>The time which is measured by this method is occupied chiefly
by nervous processes. The following factors may be specified:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
First, the auditory organ is aroused by the sound; second, the
afferent nerve transmits the stimulation to the central nervous
system; third, the central nervous system carries the energy to
the motor nerves; fourth, the efferent motor nerves transmit the
stimulus to the muscles; and finally, some time is required by the
muscle for its contraction. It will be seen, accordingly, that
the chief factors of a reaction are nervous processes, and since
the external conditions of successive reactions are in all respects
uniform, any variations in the time of a given person’s reactions
may be regarded as indicating variations in the nervous condition
of the reactor. In view of the instability of nervous conditions,
it is necessary to eliminate any slight or merely temporary fluctuations
by taking each time a given reactor is tested a series of reactions.
For this reason, a series of ten reactions was taken with
each of the men every two weeks during November, December, and
January. After an interval of two months, namely, on March 30,
31, and April 1, two final series were made with each man.</p>

<p>The results are presented in tables 1 to 5. The dates in the
first column indicate the day on which each individual set of ten
reactions was taken. The second column presents the averages
of each ten reactions in sigmas. The third column gives the mean
variations of the various single reaction times from the average.
The fourth column gives the variations of the day’s average, recorded
in column 2, from the general average of that individual
for all his experiments. These general averages are presented in
table 6. At the bottom of each complete column of averages will
be found the group average. This quantity is obtained by averaging
the results from all the members of the squad for periods of,
approximately, two weeks.</p>

<p>The mean variations in the third column make it clear that the
subjects did not settle down into what could be regarded as trained
subjects. Trained subjects are expected to give mean variations
which are consistently within the limits of 10 per cent of the
average. While there are, of course, instances in which the mean
variation falls within this limit, there is no consistent exhibition
of the regularity indicative of thorough practice. This fact is further
confirmed by a comparison of the results of March 30, 31,
and April 1 with those of the earlier months. At the end of
March, all effects of practice in November, December, and January,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
except the most general, may be regarded as having disappeared;
and yet the averages and variations for the March and April dates
resemble closely those of the month immediately preceding and
also those of November. The effects of practice may, accordingly,
be regarded as insignificant.</p>

<p>This lack of special training accounts for the large variations
which appear in some cases. As is usual in reaction experiments,
the signal to which the reactors were to respond was in each case
preceded by about two seconds by a bell signal to arouse attention.
Conditions were thus rendered as nearly uniform as possible,
but the variations indicate in three or four cases exceptional
lapses of attention. Such exceptional cases can be eliminated
without prejudicing the final validity of the results by substituting
the median for the averages. In table 7, the medians are grouped
together and show even more than the tables of average the absence
of any general variation during the period of the tests.</p>

<p>The obvious conclusion from these tests is that the quickness of
the members of the squad underwent no general change during
the whole period covered by the test. Individual members showed
variations from time to time, but these variations are clearly accidental
in character, for they show no regular tendencies and are
in no way related to the changes in the character and amount of
the diet.</p>

<h3 id="contents31"><span class="smcap">Character of the Blood.</span></h3>

<p>One question that naturally arises in considering the possible
effects of a diminished proteid intake upon bodily health is
whether a continued diminution of proteid food will have
any influence upon the character and composition of the blood.
It might be claimed, for example, that a lowering of the quantity
of proteid food below the ordinarily accepted standards
will eventually result in a deterioration in the character of
the blood. Obviously, if such should prove to be the case, it
would at once emphasize the necessity for higher standards of
proteid feeding. Further, there might result marked changes
in the hæmoglobin-content of the blood in connection with
a lowered proteid metabolism long continued. With these
thoughts in mind, a careful study of the blood of the soldiers has
been made from time to time, with special reference to determining
the number of erythrocytes and leucocytes in the fluid,
attention also being paid to the percentage of hæmoglobin.</p>

<p>Four distinct observations were made, as a rule, upon each
man, namely, in the months of October, December, January,
and March. The results are tabulated in the accompanying
tables. Examination of these results shows that, as a rule, the
number of erythrocytes, or red blood corpuscles, was somewhat
increased during this period of lowered proteid feeding.
We are not disposed, however, to lay very much stress upon
this apparent increase, because it is not sufficiently marked to
carry much weight, especially in view of the difficulties attending
the obtaining of great accuracy in blood counts in general.
Regarding the leucocytes, the figures are less definite, but may
be fairly interpreted as indicating practically no appreciable
change in the number of white corpuscles. Similarly, the
hæmoglobin-content shows no distinct alteration. Hence, the
conclusion is that the physiological economy practised by
the soldiers during their six months’ stay in New Haven, and
especially the marked diminution in the amount of proteid food
consumed, did not result in any deterioration of the blood,
so far as it can be measured by the number of contained erythrocytes
and leucocytes, and by the content of hæmoglobin.</p>

<h3 id="contents32"><span class="smcap">General Conclusions.</span></h3>

<p>Careful consideration of the foregoing data, taken in their
entirety, must lead the unbiassed thinker to admit the possibilities
of physiological economy in nutrition. That there is
no real need for a daily diet containing 118 grams of proteid
food seems clearly indicated. The members of the soldier detachment
lived without discomfort for a period of five months
on amounts of proteid food not more than one-half that called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
for by the ordinary standard dietaries, and this without increasing
the amount of non-nitrogenous food. Body-weight, nitrogen
equilibrium, physical strength and vigor, ability to respond
to sensory stimulation, the composition and general condition
of the blood, all remained unimpaired under a daily diet involving
the metabolism of only 7 to 8 grams of nitrogen per day
and with a fuel value of less than 2800 calories per day.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp95" id="illus11" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus11.jpg" alt="">
  <p class="caption"><i>Soldiers exercising in the gymnasium.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Further, the practice of such economy led to marked improvement
in the working of the neuro-muscular machinery,
sufficiently noticeable to attract the attention of the men
themselves, apart from the records of the dynamometer, etc.
Indeed, it has been the universal feeling among all the subjects
of experiment that they were less conscious of fatigue
than formerly, or that they could do more work without the
feeling of fatigue that is usually so conspicuous after heavy
work, or long-continued muscular strain. We thus have for
consideration an added factor, viz., the possible improvement
of the physical condition of the body under a lowered proteid
intake. This question, however, we shall discuss more fully
later on. It is enough for the present to simply emphasize
the fact that with a greatly diminished proteid metabolism
the body suffers no harm, the muscular machinery is as well
able to perform its work as usual, and consequently there
would seem to be no adequate reason why our daily dietary
should be cumbered with such quantities of proteid matter
as are generally considered necessary for health and strength.</p>

<p>There is one point of great importance in this connection
that should not be overlooked, viz., whether the power of resistance
toward disease is diminished in any way by a continued
low proteid intake. This is surely a proper question,
and one that must be carefully considered. Fortunately or
unfortunately, we have no facts at our disposal. We have the
belief, however, engendered by the results so far obtained, that
there is no good ground for assuming the body to be any more
susceptible to disease under conditions of low proteid metabolism
than when supplied with an excess of proteid food.
Indeed, it has been somewhat remarkable how free from all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
troubles—even during a very trying winter—the subjects of
this experiment have been. We believe that economy in the
use of proteid food, curtailment of proteid metabolism to a
degree commensurate with the real needs of the body, will
prove helpful to health, but we have no convincing facts to
present,—only the simple statement that all the men have
been well and remarkably free from colds and other minor ailments
all through the experiment.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable and suggestive fact that when a person
has once practised physiological economy in his diet sufficiently
long for it to have become in a measure a habit, he has
no desire to return to a fuller dietary rich in proteid matter.
This, it seems to the writer, is convincing proof that both body
and mind are fully satisfied with the smaller amounts of food,
and argues in favor of the latter being quite adequate for the
physiological needs of the organism. In this connection, the
writer presents a few lines received during the summer from
one of the soldier detachment. Nine of these men, after completing
their work at New Haven early in April, 1904, were
detailed for service at St. Louis, and the letter which is quoted
was written simply to ask concerning some photographs that
had been promised them. In the letter, however, occur two
or three sentences which are interesting and suggestive.</p>

<h3 id="contents33"><span class="smcap">Daily Dietary of the Soldier Detail from October
2, 1903, to April 4, 1904.</span></h3>

<p>For the first two weeks of their stay in New Haven, the
soldiers were given their ordinary army ration, which is rich
in meat and consequently had a high content of proteid or
nitrogen. The detachment had their own cook and helper,
and their food was prepared for them as they had always been
accustomed to it. Further, they had at this time perfect
freedom as to the quantity of food to be eaten, the figures
given in the earlier days representing their own choice of
quantity. Later, by the beginning of the third week, the diet
was modified somewhat by the introduction of other articles
in place of meat, especially at breakfast, so that the total
nitrogen intake was diminished in some degree, but the men
were still allowed freedom as to quantity. From November
to the close of the experiment in April, both the character
and quantity of the food for each meal were prescribed, but
great care was exercised to see that the men were fully satisfied.
Changes were made gradually and no discomfort was
felt, or at least no complaint was made, although the men
were frequently questioned and encouraged to comment upon
the dietary and to make suggestions.</p>

<p>The dietary, however, speaks for itself, and a careful perusal
of the daily record, with reference both to the character of the
food and the quantities employed, will give clearer and more
exact information as to the changes introduced than any
verbal description. The only statement that need be made
is that the heavier proteid foods were greatly reduced in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
amount, and replaced in a measure by the lighter carbohydrate
foods. Finally, it may be said that while vegetable foods
eventually predominated, there was at no time a complete
change to a vegetable diet.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="III_EXPERIMENTS_WITH_UNIVERSITY_STUDENTS">III. EXPERIMENTS WITH UNIVERSITY STUDENTS,
TRAINED IN ATHLETICS.</h2>

</div>

<p id="contents34">Men in training for athletic events deem it necessary to
consume large amounts of proteid food. Great muscular
activity, it is true, calls for the expenditure of corresponding
amounts of energy, but it is by no means clear that the energy
so liberated comes from the breaking down of proteid material.
Indeed, there is more reason for believing that the energy of
muscular contraction comes primarily from the oxidation
of non-nitrogenous matter. Nevertheless, custom and long
experience sanction a high proteid diet, composed largely of
meat or of other foodstuffs rich in nitrogen, for the development
of that vigor and strength that go to make the accomplished
athlete. For the development of new muscle tissue,
to make two muscle fibres where before only one existed, to
increase the number of available fibres, thereby adding to the
bulk of the active tissue, a certain amount of proteid food
is absolutely necessary, just as it is for all active tissues and
organs of the body. But that this fact constitutes a satisfactory
reason for the daily use of such quantities of proteid
food as usually enter into the diet of the average athlete is
very questionable.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the character of the diet frequently
made use of by men doing prolonged muscular work, I may
quote a few figures from an article by Professor W. O. Atwater<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
and H. C. Sherman on “The effect of severe and prolonged
muscular work upon Food consumption, Digestion, and Metabolism,”
in which are recorded observations made upon several
professional bicycle riders during a six-day race. On one
day subject “M” rode 334.1 miles, consuming for food on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
that day meat extract, 311 grams; milk, 4937 grams; bread,
35 grams; boiled cereals, 877 grams; pastry, 142 grams;
sugar, 53 grams; fruit, 2003 grams. His urine for the day
contained 46.2 grams of nitrogen, corresponding to the metabolism
of 288.7 grams of proteid matter. Subject “A” on
one day rode 352.7 miles, taking as food, meat, 149 grams;
meat extract, 24 grams; broth, 283 grams; eggs, 369 grams;
butter, 78 grams; milk, 142 grams; malted milk, 78 grams;
jelly, 213 grams; soup, 191 grams; bread, 361 grams; boiled
cereal, 532 grams; sugar, about 400 grams; fruit, 933 grams;
cocoa wine, 198 grams. His day’s urine contained 39.0 grams
of nitrogen, corresponding to the metabolism of 243.7 grams
of proteid material.</p>

<p>Obviously, if such high proteid metabolism as these figures
imply is a necessary concomitant of vigorous or excessive
muscular activity, then a rich proteid diet is needed to make
good the loss of nitrogen to the body; but we are more inclined
to believe that the large quantity of nitrogen excreted
was the result chiefly of the high proteid ration, and only in
small measure connected with the work done. With a sufficiency
of non-nitrogenous food, the energy of muscular contraction
does not come in any large degree from the breaking
down of proteid matter, and there would seem to be no
adequate reason for assuming a necessity for such rich and
excessive proteid diet as athletes in training ordinarily adopt.
Yet the contrary view is almost universally held and followed.
As a prominent trainer said to the writer not long ago, “if
the men are not fed on a rich meat diet and plenty of it, they
will grow soft and lose their strength.”</p>

<p>With a view to testing some of these points and thereby
broaden the scope of the investigation and enhance the value
of the study, a group of eight students in the University, all
trained athletes, was secured. These men volunteered to aid
in the study, and at considerable self-sacrifice gave intelligent
and hearty co-operation in all ways possible. The men were
under observation from January 15, 1904, to the middle of
June, 1904, a period of five months. From January 15 the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
urine was collected daily, and for a period of ten days the
regular diet of the men was adhered to without any deviation
whatever, with a view to ascertaining the extent of the proteid
metabolism characteristic of each individual. No restrictions
whatever in diet were suggested, but the ordinary
food that the men were accustomed to eat while in training
was taken. After this period the men were instructed to
diminish somewhat the intake of proteid food, and in following
out this plan most of the men diminished quite appreciably
the quantity of food consumed at breakfast time, and
in some cases stopped taking food of any kind at breakfast
other than a cereal, with possibly coffee. No specific diet was
imposed, but the men, being willing collaborators in the experiment,
gradually cut down the intake of proteid food,
diminishing likewise in considerable measure the total volume
of food for the twenty-four hours.</p>

</div>

<p id="contents35">The following brief description of the men, taken from Dr.
Anderson’s report of their physical condition, to be referred to
later, will suffice to make clear the characteristics (as athletes)
of these subjects of study:</p>

<p>Mr. G. W. Anderson is a foot-ball, base-ball, and basket-ball
player, as well as a crew man (not Varsity). Well built and
an all round athlete. 26.5 years of age.</p>

<p>Mr. W. L. Anderson, a “Y” athlete (hurdler), the captain
of the Yale Gymnastic Team, University Gymnastic Champion,
and American Collegiate Gymnastic Champion. 21.5 years
of age.</p>

<p>Mr. H. S. Bellis, a member of the Y. G. A., a gymnast
and acrobat and in constant training. 26 years of age.</p>

<p>Dr. W. H. Callahan, Medical Assistant at the Gymnasium,
in daily practice in the gymnasium; bowling, hand-ball, and
running. 27 years of age.</p>

<p>Mr. M. Donahue, a very muscular and versatile athlete, a
foot-ball player and a Varsity basket-ball player. 25 years of
age.</p>

<p>Mr. C. S. Jacobus, a “Y” athlete, a noted long-distance man,
and one of the best University runners. 22.3 years of age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span></p>

<p>Mr. H. R. Schenker, an active member of the Y. G. A., a
point winner and intercollegiate competitor in gymnastics.
22 years of age.</p>

<p>Mr. John Stapleton, a wrestler and gymnast. A professional,
a man of large body and great strength. 24 years of
age.</p>

<p>The results of the daily study of the twenty-four hours’
urine of each man for the entire period of five months are to
be found in the accompanying tables. By a careful inspection
of these data many interesting facts are brought to light.
First it is to be observed, in harmony with what has already
been stated regarding athletes, that the men, as a rule, were
accustomed to the taking of large amounts of proteid food
daily. Thus, during the preliminary period of ten days, Dr.
Callahan excreted through the kidneys 22.79 grams of nitrogen
as the daily average, corresponding to the metabolism of
142 grams of proteid matter per day, while on one day the
nitrogen excretion reached the high figure of 31.99 grams,
corresponding practically to the metabolism of 200 grams of
proteid material.</p>

<p>G. W. Anderson, during the preliminary period of ten days—on
his ordinary diet—showed an average daily excretion
of 17.18 grams of nitrogen. W. L. Anderson in this same
period excreted on an average 18.22 grams of nitrogen per day,
while on one day the excretion reached 23.42 grams of nitrogen.
Bellis showed an average daily excretion of 17.64 grams of
nitrogen during this same fore period, while Stapleton excreted
nitrogen at an average rate of 19.7 grams per day, thus indicating
an average daily metabolism of 123 grams of proteid
matter on his ordinary diet. With such data before us it is
quite clear that we have here, as expected, a group of sturdy
men accustomed to the taking of large amounts of proteid
food daily; men who clearly believed that their strength and
bodily vigor depended in large measure upon the ingestion
and utilization of these quantities of proteid food.</p>

<p>After the termination of this preliminary period, the men
began to diminish the amount of albuminous food. In doing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
this they were at first given perfect freedom, each man following
his own preferences, and making such alterations in his
diet as he saw fit. The men were instructed as to the chemical
composition of the various foodstuffs, so that they had a general
idea of what foods were rich in nitrogen and could act
accordingly. Some of the men cut down their intake of proteid
food very rapidly, others made more gradual reduction.
Some soon eliminated breakfast almost entirely. Others reduced
the amount of food at each meal. Some of the men eliminated
meat almost completely from their diet, and increased
largely the intake of vegetable food. They were all advised,
however, not to make too sudden a change in their diet, but
to adopt a gradual reduction in the daily food as being less
liable to disturb their physiological equilibrium. Naturally,
the men knew exactly how much of a reduction in proteid food
they were accomplishing each week, from the results of the
chemical analysis of the urine. Further, the record of body-weight
furnished evidence of how far the changes in diet were
affecting body equilibrium, while their own feelings and ability
to do their daily work constituted a check upon a too radical
change in living. Careful perusal of the tables will show
how far body-weight was changed, and to how great an extent
proteid metabolism was reduced during the five months of the
experiment.</p>

<p>It is plain from the foregoing results, that all the men of
this group, like the members of the professional group, experienced
no difficulty in reducing in large measure their rate
of proteid metabolism. The intake of proteid food was
steadily diminished, with a corresponding diminution in the
extent of nitrogen metabolism. Take as an illustration the
average daily output of nitrogen from April 13 to June 15,
a period of sixty-three consecutive days:</p>

<p>An excretion of 8.81 grams of nitrogen through the kidneys
corresponds to the metabolism of 55 grams of proteid
matter. Compare this average amount of proteid matter
metabolized each day with the figures obtained during the
preliminary period of ten days, when the men were living on
their ordinary diet. Then, many of the men were excreting
nitrogen at the rate of 17 to 22 grams per day. In a general
way, we may safely say that all these men during the last two
months of the experiment were living on about one-half the
proteid food they were formerly accustomed to take.</p>

<p>Further, the average daily excretion of nitrogen for the preceding
seventy-three days, <i>i. e.</i>, from February 1 to April 13,
was in most instances nearly, if not quite, as low as during
the last two months of the experiment, so that we are certainly
justified in the statement that these men—trained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
athletes, doing athletic work more or less strenuous—were
able to practise during this long period marked physiological
economy in the use of proteid food, equal approximately at
least to a saving of full fifty per cent in proteid matter.</p>

<p>The individual tables must be carefully studied, however,
in order to trace out the changes in detail in the rate of nitrogen
metabolism, and in so doing much information will be
obtained regarding modification in the excretion of uric acid,
a matter to be discussed in another connection, later on. Further,
it is interesting to note in the tables the changes in body-weight
of the men. Some of the men, like Dr. Callahan, who
were abundantly supplied with adipose tissue, lost very considerably
in body-weight, but eventually came to a standstill,
with establishment of body equilibrium, under the changed
dietary habits. Some of the men reached this condition of
equilibrium much more quickly than others. Dr. Callahan
who suffered a large loss in body-weight—to his great gain,
as he expressed it—dropped from 92.2 kilos to 83 kilos in
two months, but from March 22 to June 15 his body-weight,
while naturally showing fluctuation, did not fall
again permanently.</p>

<p id="contents38">What now was the amount of metabolized nitrogen per
kilo of body-weight in these men toward the close of the
experiment? Taking the average daily nitrogen excretion
for the period from April 13 to June 15, and the body-weights
of the men at this same period, as indicated in the
accompanying table, we have the following figures:</p>

<p>These figures, with one exception, show as low a proteid
metabolism per kilo of body-weight as was obtained with the
soldiers on a prescribed diet, yet these men were athletes
accustomed to vigorous muscular exercise, and likewise
accustomed to the eating of relatively large amounts of
proteid food. Theoretically, it might not be expected that
these men would drop to as low a level as men who were not
addicted to the consumption of excessive amounts of proteid
foods, yet for two months, and practically for a period of
four months, these University students easily maintained
themselves at this lower level of nitrogen metabolism.</p>

<p class="tb" id="contents39">From April 26 to June 13, at the request of the students
themselves, the daily diet was prescribed; not, however, as
regards the quantity of food to be eaten, but merely as to its
character. The men ate at the University Dining Hall, and
it was a simple matter to have their table supplied with a
special dietary. The following dietary was therefore prepared
for their use.</p>

<p>It is not to be understood that the men took all that the
daily list provided, but they made their selections from the
menu, and in quantity took what they deemed necessary, or
what satisfied their appetites. It may be added that the men
were all well content with the variety provided and expressed
themselves, many times, as better pleased with a simple dietary
of this kind than with the heavier proteid foods of earlier days.
It should be added that Dr. Callahan was compelled to be
absent from New Haven during a large portion of the period
covered by this dietary, hence his nitrogen excretions do
not correspond in quantity with the nitrogen of the above
rations.</p>

<h3 id="contents40"><span class="smcap">Nitrogen Balance.</span></h3>

<p>We may now consider whether these men, who had so
greatly reduced the extent of their proteid metabolism, and
who had apparently attained a condition of body equilibrium,
were truly in nitrogenous equilibrium, or free from any daily
loss of nitrogen. To test this point, a careful and exact comparison
of the nitrogen intake and output was made for a
period of seven days, commencing on May 18. This was not
easy to accomplish, as the men were still allowed freedom in
the quantity of food eaten, and also in the choice of food,
within the limits of the menu provided, so that a large number
of food analyses had to be made. A greater difficulty,
however, in obtaining proof of equilibrium lay in the laudable
ambition of the men to make a good showing,—for they had
all become interested in the main problem, and had acquired
great faith in the efficiency of a low proteid ration,—which
led them to great caution in the matter of eating during the
balance trial, thereby running the risk of diminishing in too
great degree the fuel value of the food.</p>

<p class="tb">The following data obtained with Donahue are self-explanatory.
The figures showing the quantities of food at each
meal are instructive, as indicating the general makeup of the
daily dietary, both as to quality and quantity.</p>

<p>Examination of these data shows that the total amount of
nitrogen ingested for the seven days was 61.855 grams, while
there were eliminated in the urine 53.04 grams and through
the fæces 8.192 grams of nitrogen, thus showing a plus balance
for the period of 0.623 gram of nitrogen. In other words,
with an average daily intake of 8.83 grams of nitrogen and
with an average fuel value of the food amounting to only
2450 calories per day, the body was not only kept from loss,
but was able to store up a little nitrogen for future needs.
Surely, one could not ask for any better demonstration of
physiological economy in nutrition than these data, for this
seven days’ period, afford.</p>

<p>Further, it should be mentioned, as confirmatory of the view
that this subject had long been in a condition of nitrogenous
equilibrium on about this quantity of food, that the average
daily excretion of metabolized nitrogen during this seven days’
period was 7.57 grams, while the average daily excretion from
April 13 to June 15 was 7.39 grams of nitrogen. Finally, attention
may be called to the fact that the ingestion of 8.83
grams of nitrogen corresponds to 55.18 grams of proteid food,
while an excretion of 7.57 grams of nitrogen means the metabolism
of 47.3 grams of proteid matter. A saving of more
than fifty per cent in proteid food and proteid metabolism,
with maintenance of body and nitrogen equilibrium with its
possible physiological gains is not to be ignored.</p>

following results:</p>

<p>During this balance period of seven days, 67.630 grams of
nitrogen were taken in with the food, while 49.12 grams of
nitrogen were excreted through the urine and 9.528 grams were
passed out through the fæces. This means a large plus balance
of 8.98 grams of nitrogen for the entire period, showing that
the body was being supplied with considerably more proteid
than was necessary for the establishment of nitrogen equilibrium.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
The average daily intake of nitrogen was 9.661 grams,
whereas this might have been reduced to 8.4 grams per day
with perfect assurance of nitrogen equilibrium being maintained.
Further, it is to be noticed that the average daily
intake of food for this period had a fuel value of only 2542
calories. The average daily excretion of metabolized nitrogen
during the balance period was only 7.01 grams, while the
average daily excretion for the last two months of the experiment
amounted to 7.43 grams.</p>

<p>In this seven days’ balance trial, there were taken in with
the food 76.674 grams of nitrogen, with an output of 67.47
grams of nitrogen through the urine and 12.571 grams through
the fæces, thus showing a minus balance of 3.367 grams of
nitrogen for the seven days. The fuel value of the food averaged
2486 calories per day, while the average daily excretion
of metabolized nitrogen amounted to 9.63 grams. Schenker’s
daily nitrogen excretion for the last two months of the experiment
averaged 9.82 grams. Presumably, the slight minus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span>
balance of nitrogen was due to the relatively small fuel value
of the food, which doubtless was not quite sufficient for the
body-weight, and the degree of bodily activity then prevailing.</p>

<p class="tb">With G. W. Anderson, a plus balance was obtained as
follows:</p>

<p>With G. W. Anderson, the balance trial was characterized by
an intake of 80.842 grams of nitrogen, with an output for the
seven days of 57.54 grams through the urine and 11.349 grams
through the fæces, thus making a total excretion of 68.889
grams of nitrogen, and showing a plus balance of 11.953 grams.
In other words, the body of this subject, under the conditions
prevailing, was storing up nitrogen for future use at the rate
of 1.7 grams per day. This also means that a daily intake of
9.8 grams of nitrogen would have been quite sufficient to
maintain nitrogen equilibrium, certainly with the large fuel
value of the food taken, <i>i. e.</i>, 3091 calories per day as the
average value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span></p>

<p>The average daily excretion of metabolized nitrogen during
the balance period amounted to 8.22 grams, while the average
daily excretion for the last two months of the experiment was
8.81 grams.</p>

<p class="tb">With Stapleton, the following results were obtained, showing
a distinct positive balance:</p>

<p>With this subject, the total intake of nitrogen for the
seven days’ period was 80.302 grams. The output of nitrogen
through the urine amounted to 64.03 grams, while 13.898
grams were passed out through the fæces, making a total output
of 77.928 grams of nitrogen. This shows a plus balance
of 2.374 grams of nitrogen for the seven days, indicating a
gain to the body of 0.339 gram per day. The fuel value of
the food averaged 2809 calories per day, while the daily excretion
of metabolized nitrogen averaged 9.14 grams. This is in
close agreement with the average daily excretion of nitrogen
through the urine of this subject for the last two months of
the experiment, viz., 9.00 grams of nitrogen.</p>

<p>Here, we find a minus balance of 8.773 grams of nitrogen
for the seven days’ period. The total intake of nitrogen
amounted to 61.437 grams, while there were excreted through
the urine 59.33 grams, and through the fæces 10.880 grams
of nitrogen, making a total output of 70.210 grams as contrasted
with an intake of 61.437 grams of nitrogen. This
loss of body material is to be attributed to the small fuel
value of the food,—only 2494 calories as the day’s average,—though
perhaps in part to the relatively small intake of
nitrogen. In this connection it is to be noted that the average
daily excretion of metabolized nitrogen for the seven days’
period amounted to only 8.777 grams, while the average daily
excretion for the last two months of the experiment was as
high as 10.07 grams. Undoubtedly, the subject did not eat
as much food during the week of this balance trial as was
needed to maintain equilibrium, under the conditions of bodily
activity then prevailing.</p>

<p class="tb">The same statement applies to Mr. Bellis, whose balance
trial likewise shows a deficiency of ingested nitrogen over
the nitrogen output. Here, however, the deficiency is more
manifestly due to the small fuel value of the daily food, which
averaged only 2174 calories. Bellis showed an average daily
excretion of metabolized nitrogen amounting to 8.45 grams
for the last six weeks of the experiment, while in the balance
period the excretion of metabolized nitrogen was 8.19 grams
per day. The daily intake of nitrogen in the food, however,
averaged only 7.76 grams, obviously too small a quantity to
meet the wants of the body, especially with the low fuel value
of the food. It is quite plain that during the week of this
balance trial, the amount of food consumed was not equal to
the necessities of the body, neither was it equal in nitrogen
or fuel value to what the subject had been taking during the
last few months of the experiment, and on which he had practically
maintained body-weight for at least the last month of
the experiment. It is further noticeable that during the balance
week the body-weight dropped off somewhat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426"></a>[426]</span></p>

<p>Owing to the absence of Dr. Callahan from New Haven
during this period, no attempt was made to determine experimentally
whether he was in nitrogen equilibrium or not.</p>

<p>The following tables give the data in the experiment with
Bellis:—</p>

<h3 id="contents41"><span class="smcap">The Physical Condition of the Subjects.</span></h3>

<p>Having considered the marked decline in the extent of proteid
metabolism which these subjects have exhibited for a
period of five months, and having shown the possibility of
their maintaining body-weight and nitrogen equilibrium on a
low proteid intake, coupled with a relatively small amount
(low fuel value) of non-nitrogenous food, it is appropriate to
consider next their physical condition under this changed
mode of living. So much has been written upon the necessity
of a rich proteid diet, with a corresponding rate of proteid
metabolism, for the maintenance of bodily strength and vigor,
that it becomes a question of vital importance to obtain data
bearing upon the effect of a lowered proteid intake upon
bodily strength. If, as is so widely believed, diminishing the
daily proportion of proteid food below the standards set by
Voit and other physiologists will result in a weakening of the
muscles of the body, in decreasing the strength, vigor, and
endurance of the individual, then obviously physiological
economy in this direction would in the long run be uneconomical,
and indeed injurious. The maintenance of body-weight
and of nitrogen equilibrium on a small amount of proteid
food would count for little, when compared with a gradual loss
of bodily strength and vigor.</p>

<p>It was truly a great surprise when the systematic strength
tests applied month after month to the soldiers indicated a
marked gain in muscular power, which seemingly increased
as the rate of proteid metabolism diminished, coincident with
the decrease in the amount of proteid food fed. The dynamometer
tests were applied primarily to make sure there was
no falling off in strength, and when the marked gains already
referred to were recorded, it was thought at first that they
must be the result mainly of the systematic training the soldiers
were undergoing in the gymnasium. Undoubtedly, this
daily training, with the more regular and systematic methods
of living, did contribute in some measure to the beneficial results
obtained, but as the improvement and general gain in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435"></a>[435]</span>
strength became more and more apparent, it was equally clear
there were other factors involved than mere training.</p>

<p>The opportunity presented by the present subjects therefore
was particularly desirable. These men had been in training
for many months, some of them for several years, and naturally
had acquired a high degree of proficiency in all kinds of
athletic work, in the handling of themselves and in the handling
of the apparatus, by use of which the strength tests
are made.</p>

<p>The tests, etc., were applied exactly in the same manner as
in the case of the soldier detail, description of which will be
found on <a href="#Page_259">pages 259 and 260</a>.</p>

<p>The following tables give the results of the tests—made at
the Yale Gymnasium, and reported by Dr. Anderson—from
January to June, for the eight men. It will be noted, however,
that the record of Mr. Bellis is incomplete. This was
owing to an injury to his hand, which prevented his working
with the apparatus during the months of May and June.</p>

<p>The results presented by these tables are very important and
suggestive. Every man, without exception, showed a decided
improvement in his muscular power as measured by the
strength tests. With many of the men the gain was progressive,
with others there was noticeable—as in the case of W.
L. Anderson and G. W. Anderson in the March test—a drop
in some one test. This could generally be explained by some
temporary cause. Thus, the March test taken by W. L.
Anderson was at a time when he was under great strain in
connection with an intercollegiate meet, etc. However, it is
clear from the figures presented that all these men, though
living on a greatly reduced amount of proteid food, and with
certainly no increase in the quantity of non-nitrogenous food,
showed at the end of the experiment a decided gain in muscular
power. Note for example the great gain in strength shown
by Schenker; in January his dynamometer tests, etc., indicated
a total of 5728, while at the close of the experiment in June
his record was 7135. Again, Bellis increased from 5993 to
8165, and W. L. Anderson from 6016 to 9472. Further, the
men all agree in the good effect the changed conditions have
had upon them, and they have, without exception, been able to
do their athletic work and maintain their athletic supremacy.</p>

<p>Naturally, in the case of these men the gain in strength
recorded cannot be assigned to systematic training. The only
change in their mode of living which can in any sense be considered
as responsible for the improvement is the change in
diet. The main fact to be emphasized, however, is that these
men—trained athletes, accustomed to living on relatively
large amounts of proteid food—for a period of five months
reduced their intake of proteid food more than fifty per cent
without loss of bodily strength, but, on the contrary, with a
marked improvement in their muscular power.</p>

<p>Most striking is this gain in strength when compared with
the very marked decline in the rate of proteid metabolism.
Thus, in the case of Jacobus, the excretion of metabolized
nitrogen was reduced to 7.43 grams per day as the average for
the last two months of the experiment, yet his strength test
showed an increase from 4548 in January to 5667 for June.
Further, it must be recalled that an excretion of 7.43 grams of
nitrogen means the metabolism of only 46.4 grams of proteid
matter. Similarly, in the case of Donahue, a very active man
whose work on the Varsity basket-ball team called for vigorous
exercise, his strength test rose from 4584 to 5917 on a
daily diet which led to the metabolism of only 7.39 grams of
nitrogen per day, or about 46 grams of proteid matter. Further,
Donahue frequently referred to the far greater freedom
from fatigue he experienced on the low proteid diet, and he
was clearly conscious of a distinct improvement in his physical
condition.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Yale University Gymnasium, New Haven, Conn.</span>,<br>
April 12, 1904.</p>

<p class="hanging">Professor <span class="smcap">Russell H. Chittenden</span>,<br>
<i>Director of the Sheffield Scientific
School, Yale University.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,—Herewith find a brief report of the physical condition
and ability of the eight Yale students who are taking the
special diet while engaged in active exercise.</p>

<p>These men, with one exception, Dr. Callahan, are experts in
their special lines of avocation.</p>

<p class="hanging">Mr. <span class="smcap">G. W. Anderson</span> is a foot-ball, base-ball, and basket-ball
player, as well as a crew man (not Varsity), well built and
an all round athlete.</p>

<p class="hanging">Mr. <span class="smcap">W. L. Anderson</span>, a “Y” athlete (hurdler), the captain of
the Yale Gymnastic Team, University Gymnastic Champion,
and American Collegiate Gymnastic Champion.</p>

<p class="hanging">Mr. <span class="smcap">H. S. Bellis</span>, a member of the Y. G. A., a gymnast and
acrobat and in constant training.</p>

<p class="hanging">Dr. <span class="smcap">W. H. Callahan</span>, Medical Assistant at the Gymnasium,
in daily practice in the gymnasium; bowling, hand-ball,
and running.</p>

<p class="hanging">Mr. <span class="smcap">M. Donahue</span>, a very muscular and versatile athlete, a foot-ball
player and a Varsity basket-ball player.</p>

<p class="hanging">Mr. <span class="smcap">C. S. Jacobus</span>, a “Y” athlete, a noted long-distance man,
and one of the best University runners.</p>

<p class="hanging">Mr. <span class="smcap">H. R. Schenker</span>, an active member of the Y. G. A., a
point winner and intercollegiate competitor in gymnastics.</p>

<p class="hanging">Mr. <span class="smcap">John Stapleton</span>, a wrestler and gymnast. A professional,
a man of large body and great strength.</p>

<p>These eight men are in constant practice and in the “pink of
condition.” They were in “training form” when they began the
changed diet. All have lost in weight, especially Dr. Callahan,
who has dropped from 204 pounds to 185 pounds in two months.
Dr. Callahan is not an athlete, but is a vigorous worker in the
gymnasium, being in daily and constant practice. He is liberally
supplied with adipose tissue and can well afford to drop in
weight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440"></a>[440]</span></p>

<p>As to the loss of weight in the other cases, it would not be wise
to attribute this to the diet alone. We find that most athletes who
represent the University in the big contests lose in body-weight,
but I attribute this loss as much to worry and responsibility as to
strict bodily activity.</p>

<p>These students are in a different class from the soldiers, first,
because they are well educated young men, secondly, because their
development was towards a specific end, the attainment of strength
and skill as representative Yale athletes, and thirdly, on account
of college requirements of fifteen hours per week, which time
stands for study and laboratory attendance aside from the recitations.
We have here a double drain on the body energy. All
mental work is expensive, hence the demand upon the corporeal
machinery has been very constant and strenuous.</p>

<p>I notice little change in the condition of the men over that of a
year ago, when I had most of them with me and under like physical
training.</p>

<p>In the case of W. L. Anderson, captain of the Yale Gymnastic
Association, there was a noticeable falling off in the strength tests
in February and March, but I believe the worry incident to the
intercollegiate contests, the steady training, and the business
cares of the Association went far towards producing a fatigued
state. W. L. Anderson is only a freshman in the Medical School;
he did his studying at night, and this combined with his youth
doubtless caused the loss of weight as much as any change in diet.
He has shown the same symptoms before this year. At this writing
he is in good physical condition. I speak with certainty in his
case because I have had good opportunity to study him at home.
<i>It was while under the restricted diet that he won both championships,
these being the Collegiate and All-around Intercollegiate
Championship of America.</i><a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Schenker won points for the first time in the intercollegiate
contests while on the diet; he showed no falling off, rather to the
contrary, made a steady gain in ability.</p>

<p>Jacobus complained of a pain in his side but in spite of this he
has entered a number of events, has kept up his training and is
in good condition. Jacobus is a long-distance runner; great
endurance is required for these events, and this endurance he has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441"></a>[441]</span>
kept up. He tells me his stomach is in better condition than it
has been during his three years of work at Yale.</p>

<p>Donahue has steadily improved in ability. He has kept his
position on the Varsity Basket Ball Team, and has put up strong
and aggressive games, and says he is as well as ever.</p>

<p>Stapleton shows no falling off at all. He keeps up wrestling,
which is a drastic exercise; he works at heavy gymnastics and
gains steadily.</p>

<p>One matter must be reported in reference to the strength tests.
The first trial was made when all members of the squad were
present. College men are very sensitive to competition, hence the
great exertion put forth. The other trials were made when the
men were by themselves. The “spur” was missing.</p>

<p>I have watched the efforts of these men with interest and care,
especially as two of them live in my own family. I fail to see
any falling off in strength, the case of W. L. Anderson excepted.
The fellows report being in satisfactory shape and claim that the
“ups and downs” are no more in evidence this year than in the
past.</p>

<p>These picked men, representing several kinds of competitive
sports, have gained in ability and skill on the more limited diet
they are now using, and are not showing any signs of deterioration
from the diminished intake of proteid food. I pronounce them,
from a physical standpoint, in good shape.</p>

<p class="center">Respectfully yours,</p>

<p class="right">(Signed) <span class="smcap">William G. Anderson.</span></p>

</div>

<p>It must be remembered that this letter from Dr. Anderson
was written after the March strength test was taken, and prior
to the test of April 20. Dr. Anderson was not in New Haven
at the close of the experiment, consequently it was not possible
to obtain his estimate of the men at that date, but there
can be no question that there was a distinct improvement
from the middle of April to the middle of June; certainly as
marked as the improvement from the beginning of the experiment
in January, to April 12, the date of Dr. Anderson’s
letter.</p>

<p>Finally, attention may be called to the photographs of
Messrs. Stapleton, Bellis, and W. L. Anderson, which are introduced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442"></a>[442]</span>
primarily to show the physical makeup and muscular
development of the men composing this student group.
The photographs of Stapleton were taken in April, 1904, after
he had been under experiment for three months. The photographs
of Bellis and W. L. Anderson were taken prior to the
experiment. They all afford a good illustration of the highly
developed muscular mechanism of different types, with a corresponding
adaptability for different lines of muscular effort.</p>

<h3 id="contents44"><span class="smcap">Reaction Time.</span></h3>

<p>Through the courtesy and kind co-operation of Dr. Charles
H. Judd, in charge of the Yale Psychological Laboratory, these
students were subjected to the same careful tests during the
five months of their experiment as were applied to the soldier
detail. The results which are presented in the following report,
kindly prepared by Dr. Judd, indicate quite clearly that
there was no general nervous change in the reactors as a
result of the low proteid diet. The data presented by Dr.
Judd in this connection will be found in the accompanying
tables, which, while indicating no noticeable improvement in
the nervous condition of the men, make it quite plain that
no deterioration whatever occurred as the result of the lowered
proteid metabolism.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Report on Reaction.</span></h3>

<p>Reaction tests with the group of University students were
conducted in essentially the same way as were the reaction tests
with the soldiers. Details in regard to the method and apparatus
employed need not be repeated. They can be found on <a href="#Page_274">pages
274 to 276</a>.</p>

<p>Two new tests were added to the regular reaction determinations.
One of these consisted in taking a record of the number
of taps which could be executed in ten seconds. The reactor was
seated before a table on which was fastened a telegraph key. He
held the key between his thumb and first two fingers, and at a
given signal began tapping as rapidly as possible until told to
stop. Each time he tapped he closed an electric circuit. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443"></a>[443]</span>
current thus made was carried through a marker which indicated
on a smoked paper each make and break at the key. A time line
from a rod vibrating at the rate of once every twentieth of a
second was traced on the smoked paper parallel with the marker
record. By a comparison of the time line with the marker record,
it was easy to determine the number of taps made in ten seconds.
At first, the number of taps per second were counted, but the results
showed such uniformity from second to second on a given
day that only the net results for the whole ten seconds are given
in the tables.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp53" id="illus16" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus16.jpg" alt="">
  <p class="caption">W. L. ANDERSON <span class="spacer">BELLIS</span></p>
  <p class="caption"><i>Photographs taken prior to the experiment.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The second test added to the reaction tests was undertaken to
determine the steadiness of the subjects. Two brass rods 40 cm.
long were held in a vertical position at a distance of 7 mm. from
each other. The subject took in his right hand a brass rod 40 cm.
long and 5 mm. in diameter and tried to pass the end of this rod
up and down between the vertical rods without touching them.
The subject’s relation to the vertical rods may be further defined
by saying that he stood directly in front of them and reached out
nearly at arm’s length. The vertical rods were at about the height
of his chest. In order to get a record of the accuracy with which
the subject moved the hand-rod up and down without touching the
vertical rods, the vertical rods and the hand-rod were connected
with the two poles of an electric circuit. Whenever they touched
they closed the circuit, and a marker placed in the same circuit
recorded the fact on a smoked paper record. The time was
recorded in parallel with this record, so that any long continued
contact could be measured. For the most part, contacts were only
of very brief duration. In reporting the results of this test, every
contact made while passing the rod once downward and once upward
is counted as at least one. Continued contacts are recorded
as two, three or more, according to the period of duration. Where
there are such added counts because of continued contacts, a
second quantity is given in the tables after the first. This second
quantity, which is enclosed in parenthesis, indicates merely the
number of contacts without reference to whether they are long or
short.</p>

<p>No special comments are necessary to explain the tables.
Tables 1-5 report in sigmas, or thousandths of a second, the
average time of ten reactions on the date, and for the subject,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444"></a>[444]</span>
indicated. In the third column, is the mean variation for the series
of ten reactions.</p>

<p>Table 6 shows the general averages by the month for a given
individual, and in the sixth column the general average of all the
determinations for each reactor. The fourth column in each of
the earlier tables shows how much the results of a given day vary
from the final general average. All the tables give, at the bottom,
group averages whenever the full series is present.</p>

<p>Table 7 gives the number of taps executed in ten seconds at
each successive test. The dates are not given in detail, but are
the same as those of the reaction tests.</p>

<p>Table 8 gives the monthly averages of taps.</p>

<p>Table 9 presents the results of the steadiness tests.</p>

<p>The three sets of results, namely, those from reaction, tapping,
and steadiness, differ from each other. On the whole, the
reactions grow longer; the tapping varies, but shows neither decided
improvement nor deterioration; while steadiness improves
very decidedly.</p>

<p>The comment made on the results obtained with the soldiers
applies here so far as the reaction tests are concerned. These
tests were not repeated with sufficient frequency to reduce the
reaction to automatic performance.</p>

<p>The tapping is such a simple performance that improvement is
not to be expected. The absence of any general improvement or
deterioration argues for an absence of any general nervous change
in the reactors.</p>

<p>The improvement in steadiness is in part at least, probably in
very large measure, due to the fact that the subjects became more
familiar with the test and approached it with less of the embarrassment
which attends a new and unfamiliar test.</p>

<p>The lengthening of the reaction times indicates a less intense
concentration of the subject upon the work in hand. The slightest
relaxation of attention puts the subject behind in responding to
the signal. It was clear to superficial observation, especially in
certain individual cases, that the subject was giving less attention
in the later experiments. This lack of concentration is not obviously
related to the changes in diet. Indeed, the fact that no
corresponding falling off appears in the tapping would seem to
argue that the lack of attention in the reaction tests was not due<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445"></a>[445]</span>
to deep-seated nervous conditions, so much as to growing impatience
on the part of the reactors with the ordeal of being tested.
The tapping experiment is less likely to be affected by lack of
interest on the part of the subject, because here the subject is
called upon to be constantly active, and there is no such opportunity
for attention to lapse as is furnished by the intervals which
intervene between successive reactions. The tapping is accordingly
perhaps the best series on which to base final judgment as to
the nervous condition of the men. Here, there appear the variations
which show in any ordinary series, but there is no steady improvement
through growing familiarity with the test, nor any
laxness of attention to produce relatively unfavorable results.</p>

<p>Mr. Steele and Dr. McAllister are largely responsible for the
actual collection of the data on which this report is based.</p>

<h3 id="contents45"><span class="smcap">General Summary.</span></h3>

<p>It is quite evident from a study of the results obtained in
the foregoing experiments that young, vigorous men of the
type under observation, trained in athletics, accustomed to
the doing of vigorous muscular work, can satisfy all the true
physiological needs of their bodies and maintain their physical
strength and vigor, as well as their capacity for mental
work, with an amount of proteid food equal to one-half, or
one-third, that ordinarily consumed by men of this stamp. As
the results show, all these men reduced their rate of proteid
metabolism in such degree that the amount of nitrogen excreted
daily during the period of the experiment averaged 8.8
grams, implying a metabolism of about 55 grams of proteid
matter per day.</p>

<p>In other words, these athletes were able to reduce their
nitrogenous metabolism to as low a level as many of the men
of the professional group and of the soldier group, and this
with not only maintenance of health and strength, but with a
decided increase in their muscular power.</p>

<p>Metabolized nitrogen per kilo of body-weight for all these
men, with one exception, during the experiment amounted to
0.108 to 0.134 gram per day, fully as low as was obtained with
the members of the soldier detail on their prescribed diet. It
is clear, therefore, that physiological economy in nutrition is
as safe for men in athletics as for men not accustomed to vigorous
exercise. There is obviously no physiological ground for
the use of such quantity of proteid food, or of total nutrients,
as the prevalent dietary standards call for.</p>

<p>The athlete, as well as the less active man (physically),
or the professional man, can meet all his ordinary requirements
with an intake of proteid food far below the quantities
generally consumed, and this without increasing in any
measure the amount of non-nitrogenous food.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV_THE_SYSTEMIC_VALUE_OF_PHYSIOLOGICAL">IV. THE SYSTEMIC VALUE OF PHYSIOLOGICAL
ECONOMY IN NUTRITION.</h2>

</div>

<p id="contents46">It is one of the axioms of physiology that the majority of
the diseases of mankind are due to, or are connected with, perversions
of nutrition. General or local disturbances of metabolism
are broadly responsible for disease, and with a due
recognition of this fact it may be well to consider more specifically
whether greater economy in the consumption of food,
<i>i. e.</i>, a restriction of the daily diet to amounts more commensurate
with the physiological needs of the body, may not be of
value in preventing disease, or prove of use in combating disease
when the latter has manifested itself.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, the extent and character of the metabolic
processes of the body are dependent in large measure upon the
amount and character of the diet. Further, it is equally certain
that the chemical composition of the blood and lymph is
quickly affected by the amount and character of the food
materials absorbed from the alimentary canal. Even in the
matter of secretion of the digestive juices, we have learned,
through the recent experiments of Pawlow, that the chemical
composition and solvent action of these fluids may be modified
by the amount and character of the food fed. How much
more, then, may we expect the intricate processes of cell and
tissue metabolism to be modified by changes in the chemical
composition of the blood and lymph that bathe them.</p>

<p>Further, recognizing as we must the extreme sensitiveness
of the central and peripheral parts of the nervous system
to changes in the composition of the blood, we see suggested
indirect ways by which metabolism, both general and local,
may be modified by influences exerted upon the nervous system,
whereby the nutritive condition of individual structures
may undergo change. Vasomotor influences, controlled as
they are by nerve fibres, which in turn are sensitive to the
conditions of their environment, likewise indirectly affect the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456"></a>[456]</span>
rate and character of tissue metabolism; a fact which may
serve to emphasize the many ways whereby the metabolism of
an organ or tissue may be modified through the primary influence
of a diet which, controlling in a measure the volume and
character of the circulating blood and lymph, must of necessity
exert an influence more or less extended.</p>

<p id="contents47">The one factor above all others that tends to increase the
extent of proteid katabolism is the amount of proteid food ingested.
Increase in the amount of the albuminous foodstuffs
is at once, or speedily, followed by an increase in the output
of nitrogenous waste products, the latter constituting a good
measure of the extent of proteid metabolism going on in the
body. We have been taught to believe that the healthy adult
under ordinary conditions of life needs for the maintenance of
health, strength, bodily and mental vigor, about 118 grams of
proteid food daily. This amount of albuminous food, if
metabolized, means at least 16 grams of nitrogen in the urine,
in the form of urea, uric acid, creatinin, purin bases, and other
nitrogenous products more or less closely related. Under the
stress of modern conditions and following the dictates of an
acquired taste, the daily intake of proteid food in many individuals
at least far exceeds the above figures, with an increase
of proteid katabolism equal to 18 or more grams of nitrogen
in the 24 hours’ urine.</p>

<p>When we recall that these 18 grams, or more, of nitrogen in
the urine reach the final stage of urea, etc., only by passing
through a series of stages, each one of which means the using
up of a certain amount of energy, to say nothing of the energy
made use of in digestion, absorption, etc., we can easily picture
to ourselves the amount of physiological labor which the
daily handling by the body of such amounts of proteid food
entails. Further, it needs very little imagination to see that
a large amount of energy is used up in passing on these nitrogenous
waste products from organ to organ, or from tissue
to tissue, on the way to elimination, and we can fancy that
liver and kidneys must at times rebel at the excessive labor
they are called upon to perform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457"></a>[457]</span></p>

<p>Moreover, the thought suggests itself that possibly these
waste products of proteid metabolism, the leucomaines so
abundantly formed in the breaking down of proteid material,
are not wholly free from objectionable features. If so, an excess
of such products might be advantageously dispensed with.
Indeed, we have what seems abundant evidence tending to
show that many of the nitrogenous waste products elaborated
in the body through the breaking down of proteid materials
are possessed of more or less physiological action. Even
that direct antecedent of urea, ammonium carbamate, which
we have reason to believe is formed more or less generally
throughout the tissues of the body, is not above suspicion.
To be sure, Nature has provided a mechanism in the hepatic
cells whereby it is quickly transformed into the harmless urea,
but it is only necessary to join the portal vein to the hepatic
vein, thereby throwing the liver out of the circuit, in order
to see the effect of an excess of proteid food. Under such
conditions, this is followed by the appearance of all the symptoms
of poisoning with ammonium carbamate, <i>i. e.</i>, convulsions
ending in death.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Further, we may refer to the observations of Mallet<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> with
creatin and creatinin, two conspicuous nitrogenous bases present
in muscle, which show unmistakably that these bodies tend
to retard slightly the action of the heart. This seems to be
their most decided physiological effect, although large doses
likewise cause a slight frontal headache, with some general
nervous agitation. Attention may also be called to the extremely
important experiments of Minkowski,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> in which he
found that adenin—one of the purin bases formed in the
breaking down of cell nuclei—has a most marked toxic action,
both on man and on dogs. Adenin affects the circulatory apparatus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458"></a>[458]</span>
very strikingly, increasing the heart’s action, etc.; it
acts on the mucous membrane of the duodenum, causing an
acute inflammation, thus leading to continuous vomiting, and
in addition it has a local action on the kidneys, giving rise to
a deposition in the kidney itself of spheroliths of uric acid, or
urates, which leads to an acute nephritis with albuminuria,
from which the animal speedily dies.</p>

<p>The alloxuric bases likewise cause fever when injected into
the circulation or taken per os,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and according to the recent
observations of Mandel<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> there is a very noticeable relationship
between the amount of alloxuric bases eliminated through
the urine and the temperature of the body in cases of aseptic
fevers, indicating that these substances, with possibly other
incomplete products of tissue metabolism, are important factors
in the production of febrile temperatures.</p>

<p id="contents48">Reference may also be made to our general knowledge regarding
the relationship between uric acid and gouty affections,
including rheumatism, to say nothing of the possible
relationship between uric acid and many other diseases less
clearly established. The broader question deserving attention
just here, however, is that all of the so-called leucomaines
which, as Gautier states, are being formed continuously
in the animal tissues side by side with the formation of
urea and carbonic acid, and at the expense of the nitrogenous
elements or proteid matter, are more or less toxic in their
properties, at least under certain conditions of the body. It
is perfectly clear that there are a large number of leucomaines,
or nitrogenous waste products, which are indissolubly
connected with the metabolism of cell protoplasm, and the
formation of these substances is augmented by a diet rich in
proteid matter.</p>

<p>It is well understood that the excretions of all living organisms,
both plant and animal, are more or less poisonous to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459"></a>[459]</span>
organisms which produce and excrete them. The substances
so formed originate in the metabolic changes by which complex
organic molecules are broken down into simpler compounds.
As stated by Vaughan and Novy,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> “we have good
reason for believing that the proteid molecule has certain
lines of cleavage along which it breaks when certain forces
are applied, and that the resulting fragments have also lines
of cleavage along which they break under certain influences,
and so on until the end-products, urea, ammonia, water, and
carbon-dioxide, are reached; also that some of these intermediate
products are highly poisonous has been abundantly
demonstrated.” It would therefore seem self-evident that
the nitrogenous waste products of the body, <i>i. e.</i>, the products
of proteid katabolism, may be more or less dangerous
to the welfare of the body, and consequently there would
seem to be reason in the assumption that greater freedom
from disease—especially from the so-called autogenous diseases—might
be expected where greater care is exercised in
the amount of proteid food consumed.</p>

<p>It is generally understood, or at least is frequently stated
by medical writers, that certain febrile conditions are autogenous,
and Brunton has made the assertion that the condition
termed “biliousness,” and which is most prone to occur
in persons who eat largely of proteid foods, is due to the formation
of poisonous alkaloidal-like substances which might
well be classified under the broad term of leucomaines. To
repeat, there are a great many observations and some facts
which warrant the view that the nitrogenous waste products
of the body—the products of proteid katabolism—are more
or less dangerous to the well-being of the organism, and hence
there seems justification for the belief that there is greater
safety for health and longevity in adopting dietetic habits
that are more in accord with the real needs of the body.</p>

<p>The writer’s opinion upon this question has been greatly
strengthened by the large numbers of letters he has received—during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460"></a>[460]</span>
the course of this inquiry—from persons all over
the world, many of whom in their search for health and
strength have adopted more frugal methods of living, and
who have found relief in an abstemiousness which, compared
with ordinary dietetic standards, would seem quite inadequate
to support life, yet they have recovered health and strength,
and by the judicious practice of physiological economy in
their diet have maintained health and vigor, with capability
for work that has proved a perpetual surprise to themselves
and their friends. The writer’s faith in these spontaneous
statements made by persons wholly unknown to him has been
augmented by his personal knowledge of people suffering with
various troubles, who have found relief by the simple use of
reason and judgment in the taking of food, with a view to
lowering the rate of proteid metabolism. There is no question
in the mind of the writer that excessive proteid decomposition
within the body entails possible danger.</p>

<p>If it is true, on the other hand, that the healthy organism
needs a daily intake of 118 grams of proteid food more or less,
in order to maintain physiological equilibrium, to keep up
physical and mental vigor, and to preserve the normal power
of resistance to the incursions of disease, then we must consider
that the good overbalances the evil, and that evil exists
in order that good may be accomplished. We are certainly
justified, however, in saying, on the basis of our daily observations
made on a large number of individuals and extending
over many months, that there is no apparent need for any
such amount of proteid food as is ordinarily consumed by the
average individual.</p>

<p>We can point to various persons who, for periods ranging
from six months to a year, have metabolized daily 5.5 to 7.5
grams of nitrogen instead of 16 to 18 grams, <i>i. e.</i>, they have
subsisted quite satisfactorily on an amount of proteid food
daily, equal to one-third or one-half the amount ordinarily
considered as necessary for the maintenance of health and
strength, and this without unduly increasing the amount of
non-nitrogenous food. Further, our observations have shown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_461"></a>[461]</span>
that with this great reduction in the consumption of proteid
food, with corresponding diminution of proteid katabolism,
body-weight can be maintained at a stationary figure, after the
body has once adjusted itself to the new conditions. Moreover,
there is marked increase in physical strength as demonstrated
by repeated dynamometer tests on many individuals,
which may perhaps be ascribed to the greater freedom of
blood and lymph, as well as of muscle-plasma, from nitrogenous
extractives. Lastly, we have failed to find any falling off
in physical or mental vigor, any change in the hæmoglobin-content
of the blood, or in the number of erythrocytes. In
fact, all our observations agree in showing that it is quite
possible to reduce with safety the extent of proteid katabolism
to one-third or one-half that generally considered as essential
to life and strength. In other words, there is perfect safety
in a lowered proteid metabolism, and we are inclined to raise
the question whether a daily diet containing one-half, or even
less, the amount of proteid food ordinarily consumed does not
come nearer to the normal and natural requirements of the
healthy body than the more elaborate standards we have
gradually adopted.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have suggested a radical change in diet
which experiment shows is perfectly safe, and we are disposed
to urge that there is great systemic value, both in health and
in many forms of disease, in such a change. It is obvious, as
previously stated, that the smallest amount of food that will
serve to maintain bodily and mental vigor, keep up bodily
strength, and preserve the normal powers of resistance to
disease, is the ideal diet. Any excess over and above what
is really needed for these purposes imposes just so much of
an unnecessary strain upon the organism. It entails a wasteful
expenditure of energy that might better be preserved for
future emergencies. It imposes upon the excretory organs
the needless labor of removing waste products which could
well be dispensed with, to say nothing of the possible physiological
action of these products as they circulate through
the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462"></a>[462]</span></p>

<p>Dr. Walker Hall,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> in his interesting article in “The Practitioner”
on “Metabolism in Gout,” states that “under normal
circumstances a man weighing eleven stone and performing
average work requires twenty grams of nitrogen and three
hundred grams of carbon per day.” This statement is in perfect
harmony with generally accepted views, but I should like
to emphasize the fact that all of the twenty-six men we have
been experimenting with at New Haven, representing different
types, ages, and degrees of activity, have been able to maintain
health, strength, and vigor, from six months to a year
on a daily quantity of nitrogen equal to one-half, one-third,
and even one-quarter the amount of this so-called necessary
twenty grams. Further, nitrogenous equilibrium was easily
maintained on such quantities of proteid food, and, as before
stated, there was great gain in physical strength. Are we not
justified, therefore, in raising the broad question whether such
a radical change in diet as these facts suggest might not be of
systemic value in gout, and especially in cases where there
is a predisposition to gout. Speaking as a physiologist, the
writer is strongly of the opinion, based in part upon his own
observations and in part upon both the voluntary and unconscious
testimony of others, that there is possible great gain to
the gouty and rheumatic individual by a practice of physiological
economy in nutrition.</p>

<p>Physiological economy, as the writer defines it, is not prohibition,
but temperance. Moderation in diet, especially in
the taking of proteid foods, means a great saving in the wear
and tear of the body machinery. It must presumably mean
greater freedom from many diseases in which individual
organs, such as the liver and kidneys, are frequently involved.
It suggests, likewise, greater freedom from many
disturbances of general metabolism which eventually terminate
in a perversion of nutrition, so marked as to constitute a
serious condition of disease. More specifically, lowered proteid
metabolism means diminished introduction and diminished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463"></a>[463]</span>
formation of nitrogenous products of the purin type, such as
xanthin, hypoxanthin, guanin, adenin, etc., as well as of other
nitrogenous bodies less clearly defined. Consequently, we
have as one of the results of such a systemic change in diet
a decreased formation of uric acid, or at least a diminished
output of uric acid through the urine.</p>

<p id="contents49">Obviously, a lowered proteid intake means, in some measure
at least, a decreased consumption of meat and similar products
more or less rich in free and combined purin bases. This
quite plainly must result in a diminished production of uric
acid, but the writer is strongly of the opinion that we do not
as yet possess sufficiently full knowledge regarding all the
ways in which uric acid results in the body. It is true, we
differentiate between endogenous and exogenous uric acid,
and further, we understand quite clearly that variations in
the intake of free and combined purin bases exercise a potent
influence upon the output of uric acid through the urine.
We still lack, however, concise information as to the various
ways in which uric acid may be produced, and its ultimate
fate in the body. This is well illustrated by a recent paper
from the Marburg laboratory, in which Kutscher and Seemann<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
point out the possibility of a production of uric acid in the
animal body synthetically, and likewise suggest that uric acid
may be utilized for the formation of nuclein bases, <i>i. e</i>., a
reversal of the oxidative process by which uric acid results
from the ingestion of free or combined nuclein bases, suggesting
indeed the possibility of uric acid and the nuclein bases
being produced from each other, according to the circumstances.
Thus, when nucleins or free purin bases are taken
with the food, the organism may utilize this material at once
in the synthesis of nucleins for the use of the body cells.
There is no need of a reduction of the formed uric acid to
nuclein bases, and consequently there is an increased excretion
of uric acid through the urine, but this does not result from
a direct transformation of the ingested purin material into uric<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464"></a>[464]</span>
acid, but is the result of a sparing of the already formed uric
acid. The nuclein bases thus act as sparers of uric acid.
This view explains, according to Kutscher and Seemann,
why feeding with nuclein bases increases the output of uric
acid, and feeding with uric acid—a sudden overflow of
uric acid into the circulation—is followed, as a rule, by an
increased elimination of urea, the uric acid being thus transformed
by energetic oxidation. This hypothesis is brought
forward not merely because it is an interesting suggestion,
but mainly because it illustrates that we do not as yet know
fully all the steps in the production of uric acid, nor do we
know how far the uric acid we find and determine in the
urine is a measure of the formation of uric acid in the
body.</p>

<p>Taking our knowledge on these matters as it stands to-day,
however, we find by experiment that lowering the intake of
proteid food, with its consequent corresponding diminution in
proteid katabolism, is followed at once by a marked decrease
in the output of uric acid. Let us consider a few of the data
obtained in our experiments. The first case I will refer to is
that of a college athlete (Callahan). For a period of ten days
on his ordinary diet, the average amount of nitrogen in the
urine per day was 22.8 grams, equal to the metabolism of
142.5 grams of proteid food. During this same period the
average daily output of uric acid was 1.103 grams. For the
following four months and a half, on a more restricted diet,
with a marked cutting down of the proteid food, but with no
exclusion of meat, the average daily output of nitrogen through
the urine was 9.04 grams. In other words, for this period of
over four months the extent of proteid katabolism was reduced
considerably more than 50 per cent. The average daily
output of uric acid for this same period was 0.624 gram,
equal to a reduction of about 40 per cent from his normal
excretion.</p>

<p>Another college athlete (Stapleton), on his normal diet,
showed an average excretion of nitrogen through the urine
per day, for ten days, of 19.70 grams, while the daily average<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465"></a>[465]</span>
excretion of uric acid for the same period was 0.893 gram.
On a more restricted diet, with diminished proteid katabolism,
the daily average excretion of nitrogen through the urine for
a period of over four months was 11.06 grams, while the
daily average excretion of uric acid for the same period
fell to 0.699 gram. In the first of these two cases the average
daily ratio of uric acid to total nitrogen during the period of
lowered proteid metabolism was 1:14. In the second case
the ratio was 1:16.</p>

<p>A third college student (G. W. Anderson), on his ordinary
diet, excreted through the urine for a period of nine days 17.17
grams of nitrogen as the daily average, while the average daily
output of uric acid for the same period was 0.956 gram.
On the more restricted diet of the next four or five months his
average daily excretion of nitrogen fell to 9.37 grams per day,
while the average daily excretion of uric acid was reduced to
0.632 gram. On his ordinary diet, the ratio of uric acid to
nitrogen was 1:18, while later with the diminished proteid
metabolism the ratio was 1:14.</p>

<p>Turning to another class, viz., professional men, reference
may be made to the writer, whose average daily nitrogen excretion
through the urine for a period of nearly nine months
was 5.699 grams, corresponding to the metabolism of 35.6
grams of proteid per day. During this same period of nearly
nine months the average daily excretion of uric acid amounted
to 0.392 gram, the ratio of uric acid to total nitrogen being
1:14. In passing, it may be repeated that the subject of this
experiment succeeded in maintaining a constant body-weight,
and he further avers that in physical and mental vigor he can
find no evidence of deterioration, although the amount of proteid
food consumed daily during this long period was less than
40 grams per day. Further, he was in nitrogenous equilibrium
during this period, although the nitrogen metabolized daily
amounted to only 99 milligrams per kilo of body-weight.
Another case in this same group may be mentioned, principally
because the subject for over a year became a vegetarian,
abstaining from all meat. During the last nine months, this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466"></a>[466]</span>
man (Beers) eliminated 8.28 grams of nitrogen through the
urine as the daily average, indicating a metabolism of 51 grams
of proteid material per day. During this same period, the
average daily excretion of uric acid was 0.349 gram, the ratio
of uric acid to total nitrogen being 1:23.</p>

<p>The main point to be emphasized in these results is that they
show quite conclusively how greatly the daily output of uric
acid may be reduced by diminishing the intake of proteid food,
and thereby restricting the extent of the proteid metabolism.
The ratio of uric acid to the total nitrogen excreted may or
may not be altered; this will depend in large measure upon
the character of the diet, the relative proportion of free and
combined purin bases introduced with the food, etc. As
already stated, we do not know with certainty how far the excreted
uric acid represents the formation of uric acid in the
body, but presumably there is a more or less close relationship,
and hence we are doubtless warranted in saying that the formation
of uric acid is diminished, in essentially the same proportion
as its excretion is reduced, with a lowered proteid
intake. Certain it is that several of the persons under observation,
who had troubles of a gouty and rheumatic nature in
the past, have during the course of the experiment experienced
relief, with complete and permanent abeyance of all symptoms.
The writer is firmly of the opinion that ordinary gout
and rheumatism are entirely preventable by reasonable care
and judgment in the matter of diet. Whether, when once
firmly established, in aggravated form, they will prove amenable
to dietetic treatment is not so certain, but undoubtedly
mild cases will respond to the beneficial influences of a rational
diet, reinforced by treatment adapted to the removal of urates
already deposited. In any event, due regard for the well
known deleterious effects of purin-containing foods as a source
of exogenous uric acid, and with restriction of proteid metabolism
to the true necessities of the body, should serve as an
effective means of preventing all those troubles for which uric
acid is generally held responsible.</p>

<p id="contents50">The two following tables give a summary of results bearing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467"></a>[467]</span>
upon the excretion of uric acid and its relation to nitrogen
and body-weight, for all the subjects belonging to the “professional
group” and the “student group.” Emphasis should be
laid upon the fact that these figures represent the average daily
excretion for the different individuals through the entire period
of the experiment.</p>

<p>Turning now to the third group of men, <i>i. e.</i>, the soldier
detail, under observation for a period of six months, during

<p>These figures are interesting in many ways. First, they
make clear that on the diet prescribed, these men were manufacturing
or excreting about the same amount of uric acid per
kilo of body-weight as the men of the two preceding groups,
living more or less with free choice of food. In other words,
all these men, with one and possibly two exceptions, were
practically throwing out only uric acid of endogenous origin,
<i>i. e.</i>, that which came from the breaking down of the man’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469"></a>[469]</span>
own tissue cells. Second, it is to be noted that the ratio of
uric acid to nitrogen in the men of this group varies only
within narrow limits.</p>

<p>It is very evident from these figures, reinforced by those of
the previous groups, that we can diminish greatly the output
of uric acid by simply restricting the extent of proteid katabolism,
through reduction in the amount of proteid food. Further,
we now know that this general lowering of proteid
metabolism can be accomplished not only without danger
to the body, but with a distinct betterment of the physical
condition.</p>

<p>Just here I should like to emphasize one point that appears
to me of primary importance in any consideration of the influence
of diet in gouty affections, and in so doing I merely echo
a statement made by Sir Dyce Duckworth<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>, viz., “that the
subject of gout, either by inheritance or acquirement, is so far
peculiar in his constitution that he reacts differently to various
agencies, such as climate, food, etc., from persons not so
disposed.” In this connection, let me refer again to the foregoing
table of results obtained with the soldier detachment,
remembering that these thirteen men were living under exactly
the same conditions and consuming the same kind of
food each day, and in essentially the same amounts. Yet
notice the striking variation in the output of uric acid by one
of these men (Sliney),—a variation which shows itself
especially when the uric acid is calculated per kilo of body-weight.
How can this variation be accounted for except on
the assumption that there may be personal idiosyncrasies,
personal coefficients of nutrition, natural or acquired, that
modify to some extent the production of uric acid, the oxidation
of uric acid, or the elimination of uric acid from the
body?</p>

<p>Lastly, in advocating the possible systemic value of a
lowered proteid metabolism as of value in the prevention of
gout, and of other disorders which have their origin in perverted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470"></a>[470]</span>
nutrition, I am inclined to emphasize the desirability
of using common-sense in the application of dietetic rules,
remembering that man is an omnivorous animal, and that
Nature evidently never intended him to subsist solely on a
“cereal diet,” or on any specific form of food to the exclusion
of all others. On matters of diet every man should be a law
unto himself, using judgment and knowledge to the best of his
ability, reinforced by his own personal experiences. Vegetarianism
may have its virtues, as too great indulgence in flesh
foods may have its serious side, but there would seem to be no
sound physiological reason for the complete exclusion of any
one class of food stuffs, under ordinary conditions of life.
Far more rational is temperance in place of prohibition, and
I am inclined to emphasize the systemic value of a daily diet
so reduced in quantity that the metabolic processes may be
largely decreased, in closer harmony with true physiological
needs, especially those which involve the breaking down of
proteid matter; and in making this suggestion I can add the
assurance, based upon these observations on many individuals,
that there is not only perfect safety but gain to the body, in
diminishing proteid metabolism to a level somewhere near the
actual requirements of the individual.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="V_ECONOMIC_AND_SOCIOLOGICAL_IMPORTANCE">V. ECONOMIC AND SOCIOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE
OF THE RESULTS.</h2>

</div>

<p>The importance of the foregoing results from an economic
and sociological standpoint is perhaps worthy of a brief consideration.
We have learned that a much smaller amount of
albuminous or proteid food than is ordinarily consumed will
suffice for the daily needs of the body. It remains to be
seen whether this fact will gain the popular recognition it
would seem to deserve. Ignoring for the time the matter
of physiological economy and its possible bearing upon health
and strength, it is a fair question to ask why should people
indulge in such wasteful extravagance in the matter of diet
when there is no real physiological need for it? Why not
accustom the body to a smaller consumption of food, thereby
saving for other purposes the expenditure which this excess
of food involves?</p>

<p>The question of the daily diet is one of the most important
for the family of small means, and there is no reason why the
family treasury should be so heavily drained for this imaginary
need. Simplicity of living might well be given more careful
consideration, and now that we have convincing proof of much
smaller dietetic requirements on the part of the body, it might
be well to consider the practical application these results naturally
suggest. It is obvious from our data, that it is quite
safe to diminish by one-half the amount of albuminous or
proteid food ordinarily consumed, and this without any apparent
detriment to health, and with even gain to the economy.
The ordinary forms of proteid food are, as a rule, the most
costly of dietetic articles, and since this restriction of albuminous
food calls for no great increase in the amount of non-nitrogenous
food, it is quite apparent that a great saving in
the daily expenditure can be accomplished.</p>

<p>Obviously, however, there must be a decided change in the
attitude of the public on this question before any great improvement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_472"></a>[472]</span>
can be hoped for. Habit and sentiment play such
a part in our lives that it is too much to expect any sudden
change of custom. By a proper system of education commenced
early in life it may, however, be possible to establish
new standards, which in time may prevail and eventually lead
to more enlightened methods of living, whereby there will be
less drain upon the resources of the people. With habits firmly
fixed and palates calling for new sensations, reinforced by
the prevalent opinion that by hearty eating lies the road to
health and strength, it is easy to foresee difficulty in the
advance of new doctrines along the lines indicated. The
pleasure of eating is not to be minimized. The palate serves
as the gateway through which food passes, and its sensitiveness
and power of appreciation are not to be despised.</p>

<p>Simplicity of diet, however, does not diminish but rather increases
the pleasure of eating, especially when daily restriction
in diet—indulged in until a new habit is formed—has
created a greater keenness of appetite, since under such conditions
the palate takes on a new sensitiveness, and manifests
a fuller appreciation of the variations of even a simple dietary.
There is therefore no hardship, nor curtailment of the
pleasure of eating in the restriction of the diet to the real
needs of the body. Neither is there implied any cessation
of that kindly hospitality that delights in the ‘breaking of
bread’ with one’s friends. With enlightened methods of living,
on the other hand, will come a truer appreciation of
the dignity of the body, and a lessened desire to manifest one’s
feelings of hospitality by a lavish intemperance that is as unphysiological
as it is wasteful.</p>

<p>For the rich, as well as for the poor, there is need for careful
consideration of this question of intemperance in the
daily dietary. Were this the proper place, it would be easy
to adduce figures showing the great waste which the consumption
of food beyond the physiological requirements of
the body entails. It needs no great imagination to picture
the enormous saving per capita, in dollars and cents, by a
reduction of the daily food to a true physiological basis.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_473"></a>[473]</span>
The saving to the community, to the family, might well
amount to enough to constitute the difference between
pauperism and affluence. The resources of a community,
as well as the resources of the family, are not to be lightly
thrown away. We count the cost of this or that necessity, of
this or that luxury, with careful consideration of the relative
need and expense, but in the matter of living we pay little
heed except it may be to exclude certain dietetic luxuries
which seem beyond our purse. We are prone to fancy that
health and strength are fostered by great liberality in the
amount and variety of the daily food provided, and we are apt
to express great concern if all the family and our guests do not
avail themselves to the utmost of the foods so lavishly spread
before them. The poorer man emulates his richer neighbors
as soon as his circumstances will permit, and resources that
could be much more advantageously expended for the good
of the family and the home life are practically wasted—to
say nothing of possible injury to health—under the mistaken
idea that this more generous method of living is the surest
road to health and strength.</p>

<p>Further, there is ground for thought in the possible economy
of time which an improved condition of health would result
in for the working members of the family. If greater economy
in diet will diminish the number of sick days in the year,
thereby increasing the working power of the wage earner,
and if greater strength and efficiency can be acquired at the
same time, the economic value of the proposition is at once
apparent.</p>

<p>Finally, happiness and contentment, which usually appear
in direct proportion to the health and prosperity of the individual,
may be counted upon as becoming more conspicuous in
the life of the community. So we see suggested various ways
in which the application of the principles herein laid down,
if consistently adopted and followed, may lead to a betterment
of economic and sociological conditions. The writer,
however, leaves to others, more familiar with sociological
problems, the fuller development of this line of thought.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VI_GENERAL_CONCLUSIONS">VI. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS.</h2>

</div>

<p>When this investigation, the results of which have been
detailed in the foregoing pages was first planned, it was intended
to be simply a physiological study of the minimal proteid
requirement of the healthy man, extended over sufficient
time to render the results of scientific and practical value.
There were no special theories involved, no special system of
dietetics in view, but the object was simply to ascertain
experimentally the minimum amount of proteid or albuminous
food necessary for the maintenance of health and strength,
under ordinary conditions of life. The impression in the
mind of the writer was that there was no satisfactory scientific
evidence to support the views held by most, if not all, physiologists
regarding the needs of the body for food, especially
nitrogenous or proteid food, and that the dietary standards
universally adopted by scientific men were of very questionable
accuracy, being founded mainly upon the customs and
habits of mankind rather than upon any systematic study of
what the actual necessities of the body are.</p>

<p>The results attained have certainly thrown a great deal of
light upon this question of minimal proteid requirement, and
the experimental study has been throughout a purely physiological
one, but as the work has progressed the writer has
been more and more impressed with the importance and significance
of the results in their bearing upon the broader
problem of general physiological economy in nutrition. There
is no question, in view of our results, that people ordinarily
consume much more food than there is any real physiological
necessity for, and it is more than probable that this excess of
food is in the long run detrimental to health, weakening rather
than strengthening the body, and defeating the very objects
aimed at.</p>

<p>Confining our conclusions to general statements, it may be
said that our results, obtained with a great diversity of subjects,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_475"></a>[475]</span>
justify the conviction that the minimal proteid requirement
of the healthy man under ordinary conditions of life
is far below the generally accepted dietary standards, and far
below the amounts called for by the acquired taste of the
generality of mankind. Expressed in different language, the
amount of proteid or albuminous food needed daily for
the actual physiological wants of the body is not more than
one-half that ordinarily consumed by the average man. Body-weight
(when once adjusted to the new level), health, strength,
mental and physical vigor, and endurance can be maintained
with at least one-half of the proteid food ordinarily consumed;
a kind of physiological economy which, if once entered upon
intelligently, entails no hardship, but brings with it an actual
betterment of the physical condition of the body. It holds
out the promise of greater physical strength, increased endurance,
greater freedom from fatigue, and a condition of well-being
that is full of suggestion for the betterment of
health.</p>

<p>Physiological economy in nutrition means temperance, and
not prohibition. It means full freedom of choice in the
selection of food. It is not cereal diet nor vegetarianism,
but it is the judicious application of scientific truth to the
art of living, in which man is called upon to apply to himself
that same care and judgment in the protection of his bodily
machinery that he applies to the mechanical products of his
skill and creative power.</p>

<p>Food requirements must of necessity vary with changing
conditions, but with due recognition of this fundamental
principle, all the results so far obtained in this investigation,
with a great variety of persons, point to the conclusion that
the real demands of the body for proteid food do not exceed
fifty per cent of the amount generally consumed. One-half of
the 118 grams of proteid food called for daily by the ordinary
dietary standards is quite sufficient to meet all the real physiological
needs of the body, certainly under ordinary conditions
of life; and with most individuals, especially persons not leading
an active out-of-door life, even smaller amounts will suffice.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_476"></a>[476]</span>
Excess means waste, but of far greater importance is
the unnecessary strain placed upon the body by this uncalled-for
excess of food material, which must be gotten rid of at the
expense of energy that might better be conserved for more
useful purposes.</p>

<p>Further, the <i>total</i> consumption of food by the average individual,
non-nitrogenous as well as nitrogenous, is considerably
greater than the real needs of the body demand, although
here we must give closer heed to the varying requirements of
the body incidental to varying degrees of activity. The man
whose work is mainly mental has no real need for high fuel
values in his daily ration. For such a man, a high potential
energy in the daily intake of food is an incubus and not a
gain. Body equilibrium can be maintained on far less than
3000 calories per day by the brain worker, and in the interest
of health, strength, and vigor, as well as scientific truth, why
teach the doctrine that a healthy man needs, on an average,
foodstuffs to furnish 3000 calories or more per day, with 16 to
18 grams of nitrogen in the form of proteid? Moreover, as
our experiments have clearly indicated, even the man who is
called upon to perform considerable physical work has no
apparent need for a fuel value in his food of 3000 calories per
day. No doubt, the man who works at hard labor for ten or
twelve hours a day will require a larger intake of fats and
carbohydrates, sufficient to yield even more than 3000 calories,
but this is not true of the moderate worker, nor of the
average man whose work is in large measure mental rather
than physical.</p>

<p>Finally, the writer may be permitted to express the hope
that the outcome of this experimental work will serve to
arouse scientific and intelligent interest in a subject which
promises fruitful results for the individual, and for the
community.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_477"></a>[477]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VII_DESCRIPTION_OF_ILLUSTRATIONS">VII. DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIONS</h2>

</div>

<p>Photographs of the soldiers were taken a few days prior to
the close of the experiment, just before the men left New
Haven at the termination of their work. Consequently, the
pictures show the physical condition of the men after their
long period of low nitrogen diet. Study of these photographs,
especially those of the individuals, gives a correct idea of the
appearance of the men, and shows the character of their
muscular development at the close of their experimental
work.</p>

<p>In considering these photographs, it must be remembered
that the men as a class, as stated by Dr. Anderson in his Report,
were not particularly well set up. It is evident, however,
that the subjects were in good physical condition and
had not lost any undue amount of flesh or fat. The two
photographs of Fritz, facing pages <a href="#illus02">198</a> and <a href="#illus03">203</a>, show him to
have been in fine physical condition, with even a superabundance
of fat. Steltz, on the other hand, whose photograph is
shown facing page <a href="#illus04">211</a>, was somewhat fine. This man, however,
is of quite different build from his companion, Coffman,
and was in excellent physical condition for certain lines of
gymnastic work.</p>

<p>It may be well at this point to refer the reader to the
photographs of W. L. Anderson and Bellis, facing pages <a href="#illus15">440</a>
and <a href="#illus16">442</a>. These men, typical Yale athletes, were in prime
physical condition, and the photographs were taken prior to
the experiment, at a time when they were consuming their
ordinary, rich proteid diet. It is plain, by a comparison of
these photographs, that Steltz was not trained to a much
finer point than W. L. Anderson, although he does lack the
full muscular development characteristic of the Yale athlete.</p>

<p>Sliney, whose photograph is found facing page <a href="#illus10">272</a>, was
likewise in a somewhat fine condition. He, however, like
Steltz, was in splendid physical shape, so far as can be judged
by his general health, spirits and aptitude for work. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_478"></a>[478]</span>
other men of the soldier group, whose photographs are shown,
were not trained down to quite the same degree. Both Sliney
and Steltz, however, had essentially the same body-weight at
the close of the experiment, as on their arrival in New Haven.
Steltz, indeed, weighed a trifle more in April, 1904, than he
did in October, 1903. Sliney, on the other hand, had lost
about one pound in weight. It is obvious, therefore, that
these two men do not owe their spare condition to the low
proteid diet.</p>

<p>The photographs facing pages <a href="#illus01">136</a>, <a href="#illus09">261</a>,
<a href="#illus11">284</a> and <a href="#illus12">296</a> illustrate
some of the methods employed in attempts to improve
the bodily movements of the soldiers.</p>

<p>Among the group of University athletes, the photographs
of Stapleton, facing pages <a href="#illus13">328</a> and <a href="#illus14">366</a>, show the muscular
development of a typical athlete endowed with more than the
usual amount of muscular tissue. These two photographs of
Stapleton were taken in April, after the subject had been for
several months on a low proteid diet. There is in the photographs
certainly no suggestion of any loss of muscle tissue,
and no evidence of physical weakness. Stapleton, as has been
previously stated, was an expert in wrestling and events of
that character, for which his heavy muscular build well fitted
him.</p>

<p>The photographs of W. L. Anderson and Bellis, facing
pages <a href="#illus15">440</a> and <a href="#illus16">442</a>, show, on the other hand, two athletes
whose characteristic build is indicative of ability as gymnasts.
More graceful in form, with smaller joints, and less heavy
musculature, these men, at the time the photographs were
taken, were in the pink of condition, and in a high degree of
training for their special fields of athletic work. Emphasis
should be laid upon the fact that at the time these two photographs
were taken, the men in question had not commenced
to lower their daily amount of proteid food. These two photographs
are introduced especially to illustrate the general
physical makeup of the men belonging to the group of University
athletes made use of in the experiments.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31" class="label">[31]</a> All figures for nitrogen throughout the book, whether referring to food,
urine, or fæces, were obtained by exact chemical analysis, using the Kjeldahl-Gunning
method.</p>

<p>Uric acid was determined by the method of Folin, <i>i. e.</i>, precipitation of
the urine with ammonium sulphate, etc., and titration with potassium permanganate.</p>

<p>Phosphoric acid was estimated by titration with a standard uranium
solution, using potassium ferrocyanide as an indicator.</p>

<p>At times, as will be seen from the tables, nitrogen, uric acid, etc., were not
determined in each day’s urine. In such cases, an aliquot part of each twenty-four
hours’ urine was taken and the analyses made with the mixed samples
for the given period, the figures thus obtained showing the average daily
composition for that period.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_32" href="#FNanchor_32" class="label">[32]</a> All foodstuffs were analyzed from large samples, to diminish as much as
possible the errors of analysis. Nitrogen was determined by the Kjeldahl-Gunning
method, the figures given being the average of closely agreeing
duplicate analyses.</p>

<p>While nitrogen was thus determined in every sample of food by direct
chemical analysis, the fuel value of the food was calculated mainly by use
of the data furnished by the Bulletin issued from the U. S. Department of
Agriculture, Office of Experiment Stations. No. 28</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="label">[33]</a> The fæces of this period were separated by lampblack. They were dried
on a water-bath after admixture with alcohol and a little sulphuric acid, nitrogen
being determined by the Kjeldahl-Gunning method on samples of the dry
mixture from the six-day period.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_34" href="#FNanchor_34" class="label">[34]</a> The figures given for weight of fæces during this balance period are tabulated
for convenience as above, but naturally the last yield was not obtained
until the 8th of March. The total of 182 grams, however, is the exact amount
of air-dry fæces collected between the two charcoal layers, marking off accurately
the balance period.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_35" href="#FNanchor_35" class="label">[35]</a> This balance is complicated by the loss of the urine on March 3. Consequently
one-seventh of the total nitrogen of the fæces of the period, namely
1.401 grams, was deducted from the total fæcal nitrogen.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36" class="label">[36]</a> This balance is somewhat complicated by the fact that on March 4 the
urine was lost, so that this day had to be thrown out. Correction on the fæces,
however, was made by deducting one-seventh of the total fæcal nitrogen, on the
assumption that the nitrogen-content was essentially the same for each day of
the seven-day period.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
